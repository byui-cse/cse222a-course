        <h1>Swift Programming Language</h1>

    <h1>Syllabus</h1>
    <p>
      This course is an introduction to the Swift programming language. Swift is
      created and maintained by Apple, Inc. It is the primary programming
      language for creating software for Apple platforms, including iOS and
      macOS.
    </p>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>You must have successfully completed CSE 212.</p>
    <h3>Platforms, Requirements, and Resources</h3>
    <p>
      You will need a computer running macOS, Windows 10 or 11, or Linux. Your
      computer must have sufficient hard drive space for the installation of the
      Swift IDE and toolchain, as well as an internet connection to download the
      required software.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no textbook for this course. All readings can be found in iLearn.
    </p>
    <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
    <p>To successfully complete this course, you must be able to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        translate simple, well defined, discipline specific algorithms to Swift
      </li>
      <li>create functions in Swift from well-defined descriptions</li>
      <li>
        use closures with existing functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) and
        write functions that use closures
      </li>
      <li>
        use Swift tuples, structs, classes, instances, dictionaries, arrays,
        sets, optionals protocols, generics and enums including enums with
        associated values (don't worry if you do not recognize some of these
        now, you will learn about them in the course)
      </li>
      <li>
        use guard statements and the basic do-catch-throw model to validate
        input data and deal with errors and exceptional data
      </li>
      <li>
        setup and be familiar with the development environment for Swift so you
        can write code to solve problems as part of courses in your discipline
      </li>
      <li>write code using Swift specific syntax and style</li>
      <li>
        find help for how to use Swift syntax, language constructs and built-in
        functionality
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Course Structure</h3>
    <p>
      This is a block course. In weeks 1-5 you will have assigned reading and a
      programming assignment. During week 1 you will setup your development
      environment. You are also required to join a Microsoft Teams for the
      course and to post an introduction to a shared channel during the first
      week. Teams will be the primary way you will communicate with other
      students and with your instructor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In weeks 2-5 the assignment will include downloading two files: main.swift
      and tasks.swift. You will never edit main.swift. The tasks.swift file
      contains instructions for a series of coding tasks that you will complete.
      As you complete each task, automated testing code in main.swift will test
      your solution and confirm which tasks "pass." When all tasks pass, you
      have completed the assignment for the week. You should not claim to have
      completed the assignment until all tasks pass. There are 10-11 tasks in
      weeks 2-4 and four tasks in week 5
    </p>
    <p>
      Week 6 is dedicated to you completing an appropriately sized project that
      applies what you have learned about the basic building blocks of Swift.
      You will be required to propose a project by the end of week 5 so that the
      instructor can provide feedback about the scope and direction of your
      planned project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Week 7 is an opportunity to ponder about the different sources of
      information regarding Swift that you used to help you. Use week 7 to
      create rules for yourself regarding what differentiates a good source from
      a poor one.
    </p>

    <h3>Assessments</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>For weeks 1-7, you will be given one or more tasks to accomplish.</li>
      <li>
        For weeks 1-5 you will state as true or false the validity of the
        statement, "I have completed the tasks for this week which all pass the
        automated tests and have a strong understanding of the Swift syntax and
        style we learned about this week."
      </li>
      <li>
        For week 6 you will state as true or false the validity of the
        statement, "I have completed my project and have a strong understanding
        of all the code I wrote. Also, I wrote the code using Swift syntax and
        style."
      </li>
      <li>
        For week 7, you will state as true or false the validity of the
        statement, "I have organized my thoughts and described, in writing, the
        results of pondering what determines if a Swift information source is a
        quality or poor source."
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Grade Calculation</h3>
    <p>
      There are two possible grades for this course, A or D. In order to receive
      and A grade in the course, you must do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete the week 1 task</li>
      <li>Complete the week 6 project</li>
      <li>Complete 4 other tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional</h3>
