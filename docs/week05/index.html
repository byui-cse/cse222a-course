    <h1>Enumerations with Associated Values, Error Handling and more on Closures</h1>
    <p>
      This week we will learn about an enhanced version of enumerations called Enumerations
      with Associated Values in preparation
      for learning how Swift supports cross functional Error Handling. But first we will
      review and expand on our discussion of closures.
      
      Closures are also know as \(\lambda\) functions which are
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" target="_blank"
        >mathematical constructs</a
      >
      that
      <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16501/what-is-a-lambda-function"
        target="_blank"
        >computer science</a
      >
      and computation in general has borrowed. You've used them before in your
      Python courses or as anonymous functions in JavaScript. You've also used
      them in Swift as Closures in previous weeks such as when you used <kbd>map</kbd>,
      <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd> and other built-in functions.
      
    </p>
    <h3>Storing Closures in Variables and Data Collections</h3>
    <p>
      Due to its functional programming ancestor Haskell, Swift's functions can
      be stored in variables and can also be passed around as parameters to
      other functions and methods. For this discussion, we will use the word
      "function" to mean both stand-alone functions and methods that are
      associated with classes and structs.
    </p>
        <p>
      <a
        href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/cs2704/generalization.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Generalization</a
      >
      is a common pattern that you've followed before whenever you created a
      function. You had a series of computations that could be applied to
      some data values. Using stored closures allows your functions to be
      generalized even further. It also allows more of your code to be reused so
      defects are found and fixed more readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how does storing a closure make greater generalization possible? When
      you store closures in a data structure you can retrieve the right one for
      any given situation and use it within a function. When you do that, you are
      replacing some fixed computational steps with some that are dependent on the
      situation. Consider this example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you are creating a calculator app.  You might start with just addition
      and subtraction defined like this:
      <pre><code class="Swift">enum OperationType {
    case plus
    case minus
}

func handleOperation(operation: OperationType) {
    if operation == plus {
        // perform plus operation
    } else if operation == minus {
        // perform minus operation
    } else 
        // report invalid operation
}</code></pre>

      Each time an operation is performed, this function needs to go through an if/else
      list of operations and find the right code. With two operations that is simple,
      but if this were a scientific calculator with many operations, the if/then
      list would get long and going through every operation sequentially would add
      overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose instead you have a Dictionary where the key is the operation
      and the value for that key is a closure. Let's call this type
      <kbd>OperatorDictionary</kbd>. Here is a
      <a
        href="https://www.programiz.com/swift-programming/typealias"
        target="_blank"
        >typealias</a
      >
      to make it easier to read code later.
    </p>
        <pre><code class="Swift">//some aliases to make the code easier to read
// An OperatorClosure is a closure that takes two Int parameters and returns an Int
typealias OperatorClosure = (Int, Int) -> Int
// An OperatorDictionary has an Operatortype for each key
//     and an OperatorClosure for each value.
typealias OperatorDictionary = Dictionary<OperatorType, OperatorClosure></code></pre>      
    <p>
      We can create a Dictionary that stores the closures for each operator and
      the code to handle operations will call the closures like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">let operatorFunctions: OperatorDictionary = [
    .plus: { (lhs, rhs) in
        // code to process plus operator
        // then return the result
    }
    .minus: { (lhs, rhs) in
        // code to process minus operator
        // then return the result
    }
]

func handleOperation(operation: OperationType, lhs: Int, rhs: Int) -> Int {
      guard let operationClosure = operatorFunctions(operations) else {
          // report or handle invalid operation
      }
      // handle any common setup for operators
      // then perform the operation
      let retValue = operationClosure(lhs, rhs)
      // handle any common post operation details
      // then return the result
      return retValue
}</code></pre>
  <p>
    We can add code in <kbd>handleOperation()</kbd> to do any common processing
    of operations before or after calling the closure. To add another operation,
    we simply add a value to the OperationType enum and then add a closure to
    operatorFunctions to handle that operation. This helps us have cleaner code
    with the code to handle operations organized in the closure Dictionary. You could
    even define the operatorFunctions Dictionary as a var so it can be modified
    and then have code that replaces the closures depending on circumstances.
  </p>

              <h3>Passing Functions or Closures as Parameters</h3>
    <p>
      You've used functions that had other functions as parameters. The
      <kbd>map()</kbd>, <kbd>filter()</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce()</kbd>
      functions last week leveraged this concept heavily. But you are not
      limited to being able to do this with Built-in Functions. You can write your own
      functions that do this as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time you want to make your functions more abstract and therefore more
      powerful, you can pass part of the behavior of the function as a
      parameter. If you think about it, the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function
      above does this. It just passes collections of functions or closures
      instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a function as a parameter allows a programmer to decide later, long
      after you've written your function, some of the behavior of your
      function should have. That way your function can be reused and there will be
      less code duplication in the application.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following is an example that illustrates the principle. In a real 
      application, you should use the <kbd>reduce</kbd> built-in function, but let's
      use this example to look at how you could use a closure as a parameter.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="Swift">func doIntegerMath(integers:[Int], initialValue:Int, mathToDo:(Int, Int)->Int) -> Int {
    var accumulator = initialValue
    for integer in integers {
        accumulator = mathToDo(accumulator,integer)
    }
    return accumulator
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter is a function that has
      two integer parameters and has an integer as it's value. The
      <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter's type declaration ends at the
      <kbd>)</kbd> character that concludes the list of parameters for the
      <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function. The <kbd>-> Int</kbd> characters after
      that indicate the value of the <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how similar <kbd>mathToDo</kbd>'s type declaration is to a regular
      function definition. If it were a function declaration, the only thing
      that would be missing would be the names of the parameters. Please don't
      put parameter names in the declaration of the Type of a closure. 
      Type definitions for closures only list the types of the parameters. 
      You can optionally assign them names in the closure itself or just 
      choose to use $0, $1, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another place we use closures is in processes that do input and output such 
      as reading and writing files and accessing data from the internet.
      We will not cover that in this course, but being comfortable with closures
      and the other topics we will cover this week will help you be prepared to work 
      with those operations.
    </p>
              
              <h3>Enumerations with Associated Values</h3>
              <p>
                You have used Swift <a
                  href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/enumerations/"
                  target="_blank"
                >enumerations</a
                  > for several weeks now, but there is an additional feature we need
                  to discuss that allows enumerations to have extra values of any 
                  types that are associated with any or each of the enumeration values.
                  This provides functionality similar to 
                  <kbd>discriminated unions</kbd>, <kbd>tagged unions</kbd>, or 
                  <kbd>variants</kbd> in some other languages. Here is an 
                  example from the Apple documentation that stores the value of 
                  a barcode whether it is a UPC or a QR code:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum Barcode { 
    case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int) 
    case qrCode(String) 
}</code></pre> 
                  <p>
              We can use these just like other <kbd>enum</kbd> values, assigning them to 
              constants or variables and even creating an Array of them. This is 
              a way that an Array can seem to have values of different types. All 
              would be of the same <kbd>enum</kbd> type, but they each can have different 
              associated values included with them. For example:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">let barcodes: [Barcode] = [
        .qrCode("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP")
        .upc(8, 85909, 51226, 3),
    ]
</code></pre> 
<p>
              This is an array of the BarCode type, but the array values are 
              very different from each other. We extract the associated values from 
              an <kbd>enum</kbd> in a <kbd>switch</kbd> statement by putting a parenthesized 
              list of constant or variable names preceded by <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>var</kbd> 
              after the <kbd>case enumValue</kbd> like the .qrCode example below. If we are 
              extracting several values all as <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>var</kbd>, we can put
              the <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>var</kbd> once right after the keyword <kbd>case</kbd> 
              like the .upc example below.
</p>
<pre><code class="Swift">switch barcodes[0] {
    case .qrCode(let productCode):
        print("QR: \(productCode).")
    case let .upc(numberSystem, manufacturer, product, check):
        print("UPC : \(numberSystem), \(manufacturer), \(product), \(check).")
}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    An enum Type can define some enum values as having one associated value,
                    other enum values with several associated values and some enum values
                    with no associated values. Remember that when you do a switch statement
                    to process objects of an enum Type, you must cover all cases. You can list several
                    enum values separated by commas in a single case statement. If you do not
                    list all possible values of whatever follows the keyword switch, you need
                    to add a "default:"  option in addition to the various "case ...:" options.
                  </p>
                  <pre><code class="Swift">enum SomeEnum { 
    case enum1(String)
    case enum2(Int, Int, Double, Bool)
    case enum3
    case enum4
    case enum5
    case enum6
    case enum7
}
func processSomeEnum(anEnum: SomeEnum) {
    switch anENum {
        case .enum1(let aString):
            print("String: \(aString))
        case let .enum2(anInt, anotherInt, aDouble, aBool):
            print("Values associated with enum2: \(anInt), \(anotherInt), \(aDouble), \(aBool))
        case .enum3, .enum4:
            print("Enum was enum3 or enum4)
        default:
            print("Some other enum value")
    }
}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    One key use of enumerations with associated values to define error conditions for Swifts approach to error handling.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Error Handling in Swift</h3>
                <p>
                You are already familiar with Swifts pattern of handling local 
                errors using <kbd>guard</kbd> statements at the start of functions and 
                loops to protect the code beyond them from invalid or unexpected 
                values. But what about errors that need to be handled beyond that 
                  local scope? Swift supports a <a
                    href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/errorhandling/"
                    target="_blank"
                  >do-catch-throw model</a> similar to some other languages to handle those errors.  
                </p>
                  <p>
                    There are four steps to implement do-catch-throw:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Define a type that conforms to the <kbd>Error</kbd> protocol. This protocol 
                      does not have any requirements, but indicates the type can be used 
                      for error handling. Enumerations with associated values are a 
                      great option for this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum SomeErrorType: Error {
    case oneError
    case anotherError(String)
    case errorWithInts(Int, Int)
}</code></pre>
                    <li>Label a function that can throw an error by adding the keyword 
                      <kbd>throws</kbd> to the function definition after its parameters.
                      If the function has a return value then <kbd>throws</kbd> should appear
                      just before the <kbd>-&gt;</kbd>.</li>
                    <li>Inside that function, use the keyword <kbd>throw</kbd> to throw an object of a 
                      defined error type like this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">func canThrow() throws -> Int {
    <i>some code</i>
    if <i>error-happens</i> {
        throw SomeErrorType.anotherError(“some string”)
    }
    <i>more code</i>
    return someInt
}</code></pre>
                    <li>When you call a function that can throw errors, call it using 
                      the do-try-catch pattern like this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">do {
        let anInt = try canThrow()
    } catch SomeErrorType.oneError {
        <i>handle error</i>
    } catch SomeErrorType.anotherError(let aString) {
        <i>handle error</i>
    } catch errorWithInts(var Int1, Int2) {
        <i>handle error</i>
    } catch {
        <i>handle other error or</i>
        throw error
    }
}</code></pre>
                    </ol>
                  <p>
                    Each phrase after the keyword <kbd>catch</kbd> is a <a
                      href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/patterns/"
                      target="_blank"
                    >Pattern</a> that usually will be a value of the enumeration Type
                    that you define for reporting errors. Note that if an enumeration value 
                    has associated values, you need to include a let or var placeholder 
                    for them that will be filled in with the values. Those variables or
                    constants can then be used in the code labeled with the placeholder 
                    “handle error” above.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Also note that <b>you must always include a generic "catch" statement at the
                    end</b> to catch any other errors that happen. If those are errors your code
                    cannot deal with, you can call "throw error" in that handler to pass the
                    error for handling further up the call stack. The generic catch statement
                    has <kbd>catch</kbd> without a pattern and will pick up any errors not 
                    listed previously. In that case the error message will be 
                    available to your code in a global variable called <kbd>error</kbd>.
                    That is why "throw error" will pass the error information up the call
                    chain. You could just use <kbd>catch</kbd> without a pattern 
                    to handle all errors. But often you will want to catch a few errors and handle them in the funcation.
                  </p>
                  One other option you can use instead of do-try-catch is to just put 
                  <kbd>try?</kbd> in front of a function call that can throw an error. 
                  In that case, the value of the function will return an optional-wrapped 
                  version of the return value if there is no error. But if an error is 
                  thrown then the function will return nil. This allows you to easily 
                  deal with errors if you don’t need to handle or report on what 
                  went wrong like this:                  <p>
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">guard let anInt = try? canThrow() else {
    <i>report error, then</i> return, continue or break
}</code></pre>
