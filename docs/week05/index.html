      and computation in general has borrowed. You've used them before in your
      Python courses or as anonymous functions in JavaScript. You've also used
      them in Swift as Closures when you did the <kbd>map</kbd>,
      <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd> and other tasks. Now let's learn some more
      about them. Then we will learn a bit more about enumerations in preparation
      for learning how Swift support Error Handling. Finally we will demonstrate
      basic read to data from a web site API and learn how to decode the data received.
    </p>
    <h3>Storing Closures in Variables and Data Collections</h3>
    <p>
      Due to its functional programming ancestor Haskell, Swift's functions can
      be stored in variables and can also be passed around as parameters to
      other functions and methods. (From this point on, we'll use the word
      function to mean both stand-alone functions and methods.)
      <a
        href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/cs2704/generalization.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Generalization</a
      >
      is a common pattern that you've followed before whenever you created a
      function. You had a series of computations that could be applied to
      various data values. Using stored closures allows your functions to be
      generalized even further. It also allows more of your code to be reused so
      defects are found and fixed more readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how does storing a closure make greater generalization possible? When
      you store closures in a data structure you can retrieve the right one for
      any given situation and use it within a function, you are replacing some
      of the fixed computational steps with some that are dependent on the
      situation. Consider this example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you are creating a web service of some kind. Each time a request
      comes in from a web browser there is some sort of a command (login,
      logout, update something, download something, display something, etc.) and
      some data that goes along with the command (username and password, the
      name of the file to download, the data from the file to store on the
      server, etc.). You could write a function with a huge
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause where each branch of the
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause checks the command and executes code inside the
      scope of the correct branch to deal with the data sent. This naive design
      has many problems and would look something like the code below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">func handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:DataDictionary){
	if aCommand == "login"{
		//login handling code here
	}
	else if aCommand == "logout"{
		//logout handling code here
	}
	else if aCommand == "upload"{
		//file upload handling code here
	}
	/*
	 * and another, and another, and another, and another,....
	 */
	else{
		//unrecognized command handling code here
	}
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      What kinds of problems might this cause? Well, first there is the
      <a
        href="https://www.springboottutorial.com/code-quality-what-is-code-duplication"
        target="_blank"
        >duplication of code</a
      >
      all over the place. Do you really want to type
      <kbd>else if aCommand ==</kbd> dozens or maybe hundreds of times? Stepwise
      debugging such a mess can also be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is even a bigger problem. What order are you going to do the
      checks in? String comparison is an expensive computation to perform in any
      language so you should put the most commonly used commands first. But
      which command is that? The most commonly used command will change over
      time, so you need to make sure to always check what your users are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In web services you usually similar things each time a command-data
      pairing is received. First you need to make sure the command is a valid
      command. You also need to validate the data. After validating both things, 
      your web service will usually interact with a database. This could include 
      getting data from the database, putting data in the database, or both. Then 
      your service will put together some data to send back to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      These steps are performed over and over. At major web sites these steps
      are performed millions of times a minute. The <kbd>if-else</kbd> design 
      isn't going to be good enough. How then can this be made better? The 
      solution to this lies in using a Dictionary and the principle that 
      functions and closures are
      <a href="https://lispcast.com/what-are-first-class-functions/"
        >first class citizens</a
      >
      in Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a Dictionary where the key is the command
      and the value for that key is a closure. Let's call this type
      <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd>. Here are a couple of
      <a
        href="https://www.programiz.com/swift-programming/typealias"
        target="_blank"
        >typealiases</a
      >
      to make it easier to read code later.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">//some aliases to make the code easier to read
typealias DataDictionary = Dictionary&lt;String,Any&gt;
typealias CommandFunction = (DataDictionary) -> (CommandMessages, DataDictionary?)
typealias CommandDictionary = 
      Dictionary&lt;String, CommandFunction&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      This supposes that we have an enum Type of possible errors (and .success) called 
      <kbd>StatusMessages</kbd>. Each entry in our <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd> has
      a <kbd>String</kbd> as key and a closure as the value. What will the closure
      use as a parameter and return value? The <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> type has
      a <kbd>String</kbd> as the key and can have any data as the value. 
      That way different commands can receive different kinds of data.
    </p>
        <p>
      We have already worked with data of Type <kbd>Any</kbd> and used 
      <kbd>as?</kbd> to pull the underlying data Type back out if it is there. 
      Each closure would use <kbd>as?</kbd> to try to pull the parameters it 
      expects out of the <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
      The keys in the <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> would contain the parameter 
      names and the values would be the value for those parameters. For example, 
      suppose the closure would expect parameters like:
        <p>
      <pre><code class="Swift">(fileName: “myFile.txt”, charsToRead: 40)</code></pre>
          <p>
        then the <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> that would be the actual parameter 
        would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="Swift">(data: [“fileName” : “myFile.txt”, “charsToRead” : 40])</code></pre>
          <p>
      Inside the closure you would need code like this:
      <pre><code class="Swift">guard let fileName = data[“filename”] as? String else { handle error }
guard let charsToRead = data[“charsToRead”] as? Int else { handle error }</code></pre>
            <p>
      This is a bit more overhead at the start of the closure, but it allows 
      each closure in the CommandDictionary to receive its own unique
      list of parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
      When we set up a command parser, we can define a function that is called 
      to load each command key with a closure into a <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd> we could 
      call <kbd>commands</kbd>. As mentioned, we also have an enum Type of possible Error 
      Codes (plus one for .success) called <kbd>StatusMessages</kbd>. With those assumptions
      our execution engine look like this:
<pre><code class="Swift">enum CommandMessages {
    case success
    case invalidCommand
}
      
func handleRequest(command: String, dataIn: DataDictionary) -> (CommandMessages, DataDictionary?) {
    guard let commandFunction = commands[command] else {
        var resposeData = dataIn
        resposeData["response"] = "\(command) is not a valid command"
        return (.invalidCommand, resposeData)
    }
    let (message, responseData) = commandFunction(dataIn)
    guard let responseData = responseData, message == .success else {
        return (message, dataIn)
    }
    return (.success, responseData)
}</code></pre>
              
  <p>
    This allows us to write and test a closure for each command. We would
    need to have a way to make those closures accessible to handleRequest(), 
    something like this:
  </p>
              <pre><code class="Swift">var commands: CommandDictionary = [:]

func loadCommand(command: String, aFunc: @escaping CommandFunction) {
    if command != "" {
        commands[command] = aFunc
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, if there we want to separate the processing of
      commands into three separate phases for each command, we could 
       implement three separate instances of <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd>. 
        Our execution engine would validate that the command has been loaded 
        in all three dictionaries. It would then pass the parameters to the 
        closure in the first one, pass the output from that to the closure in
        the second Dictionary and the output from the second to the third. 
        The output of the third would go back to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any step failed, the other steps would not be executed. And, 
        for example, if a password were validated in the first closure 
        then it would not need to be passed to the other closures, thus 
        reducing the amount of code with visibility to the password.
      </p>

              <h3>Passing Functions or Closures as Parameters</h3>
    <p>
      You've used functions that had other functions as parameters. The
      <kbd>map, filter,</kbd> and <kbd>reduce</kbd>
      functions last week leveraged this concept heavily. But you are not
      limited to being able to do this with Built-in Functions. You can write your own
      functions that do this as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time you want to make your functions more abstract and therefore more
      powerful, you can pass part of the behavior of the function as a
      parameter. If you think about it, the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function
      above does this. It just passes collections of functions or closures
      instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a function as a parameter allows a programmer to decide later, long
      after you've written your function, what some of the behavior of your
      function should be. That way your function can be reused and there will be
      less code duplication in the application.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following is an example that illustrates the principle. In a real 
      application, you should use the <kbd>reduce</kbd> BIF, but let's
      use this example to look at how you could use a closure as a parameter.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="Swift">func doIntegerMath(integers:[Int], initialValue:Int, mathToDo:(Int, Int)->Int) -> Int {
    var accumulator = initialValue
    for integer in integers {
        accumulator = mathToDo(accumulator,integer)
    }
    return accumulator
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter is a function that has
      two integer parameters and has an integer as it's value. The
      <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter's type declaration ends at the
      <kbd>)</kbd> character that concludes the list of parameters for the
      <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function. The <kbd>-> Int</kbd> characters after
      that indicate the value of the <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how similar <kbd>mathToDo</kbd>'s type declaration is to a regular
      function definition. If it were a function declaration, the only thing
      that would be missing would be the names of the parameters. Please don't
      put parameter names in the declaration of the Type of a closure. 
      Type definitions for closures only list the types of the parameters. 
      You can optionally assign them names in the closure itself or just 
      choose to use $0, $1, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another place we use closures is in processes that do input and output such 
      as reading and writing files and accessing data from the internet.
      We will discuss an example of that, but first we need to review a few 
      other concepts to get ready for that topic.
    </p>
              
              <h3>Enumerations with Associated Values</h3>
              <p>
                You have used Swift <a
                  href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html"
                  target="_blank"
                >enumerations</a
                  > for several weeks now, but there is an additional option we need
                  to discuss that allows enumerations to have extra values of any 
                  types be associated with any or each of the enumeration values.
                  This provides functionality similar to 
                  <kbd>discriminated unions</kbd>, <kbd>tagged unions</kbd>, or 
                  <kbd>variants</kbd> in some other languages. Here is an 
                  example from the Apple documentation that stores the value of 
                  a barcode whether it is a UPC or a QR code:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum Barcode { 
    case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int) 
    case qrCode(String) 
}</code></pre> 
                  <p>
              We can use these just like other <kbd>enum</kbd> values, assigning them to 
              constants or variables and even creating an Array of them. This is 
              a way that an Array can seem to have values of different types. All 
              would be of the same <kbd>enum</kbd> type, but they each can have different 
              associated values included with them. For example:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">let barcodes: [Barcode] = [
        .qrCode("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP")
        .upc(8, 85909, 51226, 3),
    ]
</code></pre> 
<p>
              This is an array of the BarCode type, but the array values are 
              very different from each other. We extract the associated values from 
              an <kbd>enum</kbd> in a <kbd>switch</kbd> statement by putting a parenthesized 
              list of constant or variable names preceded by <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>var</kbd> 
              after the <kbd>case enumValue</kbd> like the .qrCode example below. If we are 
              extracting several values all as <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>var</kbd>, we can put
              the <kbd>let</kbd> or <kbd>var</kbd> once right after the keyword <kbd>case</kbd> 
              like the .upc example below.
</p>
<pre><code class="Swift">switch barcodes[0] {
    case .qrCode(let productCode):
        print("QR: \(productCode).")
    case let .upc(numberSystem, manufacturer, product, check):
        print("UPC : \(numberSystem), \(manufacturer), \(product), \(check).")
}</code></pre>
                  <p>
One key use of enumerations with associated values to define error conditions for Swifts approach to error handling.
              </p>

                  <h3>Error Handling in Swift</h3>
                <p>
                You are already familiar with Swifts pattern of handling local 
                errors using <kbd>guard</kbd> statements at the start of functions and 
                loops to protect the code beyond them from invalid or unexpected 
                values. But what about errors that need to be handled beyond that 
                  local scope? Swift support a <a
                    href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html"
                    target="_blank"
                  >do-catch-throw model</a> similar to some other languages to handle those errors.  
                </p>
                  <p>
                    There are four steps to implement do-catch-throw:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Define a type that conform to the <kbd>Error</kbd> protocol. This protocol 
                      does not have any requirements, but indicates the type can be used 
                      for error handling. Enumerations with associated values are a 
                      great option for this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum SomeErrorType: Error {
    case oneError
    case anotherError(String)
    case errorWithInts(Int, Int)
}</code></pre>
                    <li>Label a function that can throw an error by adding the keyword 
                      <kbd>throws</kbd> to the function definition, after its parameters 
                      and before the <kbd>-&gt;</kbd> (if it has a return value).</li>
                    <li>Use the keyword <kbd>throw</kbd> to throw an object of a 
                      defined error type like this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">func canThrow() throws -> Int {
    some code
    if error-happens {
        throw SomeErrorType.anotherError(“some string”)
    }
    more code
    return someInt
}</code></pre>
                    <li>When you call a function that can throw errors, call it using 
                      the do-try-catch pattern like this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">do {
        let anInt = try canThrow()
    } catch SomeErrorType.oneError {
        handle error
    } catch SomeErrorType.anotherError(let aString) {
        handle error
    } catch errorWithInts(var Int1, Int2) {
        handle error
    } catch {
        handle other error
    }
}</code></pre>
                    </ol>
                  <p>
                    Each phrase after the <kbd>catch</kbd> is a <a
                      href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html"
                      target="_blank"
                    >Pattern</a> that usually will be a value ]of the error handling 
                    enumeration Type that you define. Note that if an enumeration value 
                    has associated values, you need to include a let or var placeholder 
                    for them that will be filled in with the values. Those variables or
                    constants can then be used in the code labeled “handle error” above.
                    Also note that you must alway include a generic catch statement at the
                    end to catch any other errors that happen. If those are errors your code
                    cannot deal with you can call throw error in that handler to pass the
                    error for handling further up the call stack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <kbd>catch</kbd> without a pattern will pick up any errors not 
                    listed previously. You could just use <kbd>catch</kbd> without a pattern 
                    to handle all errors. In that case the error message will be 
                    available to your code in a global variable called <kbd>error</kbd>.
                  </p>
                  One other option you can use instead of do-try-catch is to just put 
                  <kbd>try?</kbd> in front of a function call that can throw an error. 
                  In that case, the value of the function will return an optional-wrapped 
                  version of the return value if there is no error. But if an error is 
                  thrown then the function will return nil. This allows you to easily 
                  deal with errors if you don’t need to handle or report on what 
                  went wrong like this:                  <p>
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">guard let anInt = try? canThrow() else {
    report error, then return, continue or break
}</code></pre>
