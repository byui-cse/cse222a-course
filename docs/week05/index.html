      and computation in general has borrowed. You've used them before in your
      Python courses or as anonymous functions in JavaScript. You've also used
      them in Swift as Closures when you did the <kbd>map</kbd>,
      <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd> and other tasks. Now let's learn some more
      about them. Then we will learn a bit more about enumerations in preparation
      for learning how Swift support Error Handling. Finally we will demonstrate
      basic read to data from a web site API and learn how to decode the data received.
    </p>
    <h3>Storing Closures in Variables and Data Collections</h3>
    <p>
      Due to its functional programming ancestor Haskell, Swift's functions can
      be stored in variables and can also be passed around as parameters to
      other functions and methods. (From this point on, we'll use the word
      function to mean both stand-alone functions and methods.)
      <a
        href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/cs2704/generalization.html"
        target="_blank"
        >Generalization</a
      >
      is a common pattern that you've followed before whenever you created a
      function. You had a series of computations that could be applied to
      various data values. Using stored closures allows your functions to be
      generalized even further. It also allows more of your code to be reused so
      defects are found and fixed more readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how does storing a closure make greater generalization possible? When
      you store closures in a data structure you can retrieve the right one for
      any given situation and use it within a function, you are replacing some
      of the fixed computational steps with some that are dependent on the
      situation. Consider this example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you are creating a web service of some kind. Each time a request
      comes in from a web browser there is some sort of a command (login,
      logout, update something, download something, display something, etc.) and
      some data that goes along with the command (username and password, the
      name of the file to download, the data from the file to store on the
      server, etc.). You could write a function with a huge
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause where each branch of the
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause checks the command and executes code inside the
      scope of the correct branch to deal with the data sent. This naive design
      has many problems and would look something like the code below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">func handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:DataDictionary){
	if aCommand == "login"{
		//login handling code here
	}
	else if aCommand == "logout"{
		//logout handling code here
	}
	else if aCommand == "upload"{
		//file upload handling code here
	}
	/*
	 * and another, and another, and another, and another,....
	 */
	else{
		//unrecognized command handling code here
	}
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      What kinds of problems might this cause? Well, first there is the
      <a
        href="https://www.springboottutorial.com/code-quality-what-is-code-duplication"
        target="_blank"
        >duplication of code</a
      >
      all over the place. Do you really want to type
      <kbd>else if aCommand ==</kbd> dozens or maybe hundreds of times? Stepwise
      debugging such a mess can also be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is even a bigger problem. What order are you going to do the
      checks in? String comparison is an expensive computation to perform in any
      language so you should put the most commonly used commands first. But
      which command is that? The most commonly used command will change over
      time, so you need to make sure to always check what your users are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In web services you usually similar things each time a command-data
      pairing is received. First you need to make sure the command is a valid
      command. You also need to validate the data. After validating both things, 
      your web service will usually interact with a database. This could include 
      getting data from the database, putting data in the database, or both. Then 
      your service will put together some data to send back to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      These steps are performed over and over. At major web sites these steps
      are performed millions of times a minute. The <kbd>if-else</kbd> design 
      isn't going to be good enough. How then can this be made better? The 
      solution to this lies in using a Dictionary and the principle that 
      functions and closures are
      <a href="https://lispcast.com/what-are-first-class-functions/"
        >first class citizens</a
      >
      in Swift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a Dictionary where the key is the command
      and the value for that key is a closure. Let's call this type
      <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd>. Here are a couple of
      <a
        href="https://www.programiz.com/swift-programming/typealias"
        target="_blank"
        >typealiases</a
      >
      to make it easier to read code later.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">//some aliases to make the code easier to read
typealias DataDictionary = Dictionary&lt;String,Any&gt;
typealias CommandDictionary = 
      Dictionary&lt;String,(DataDictionary) -> (StatusMessages, DataDictionary?)&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>
      This supposes that we have an enum Type of possible errors (and .success) called 
      <kbd>StatusMessages</kbd>. Each entry in our <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd> has
      a <kbd>String</kbd> as key and a closure as the value. What will the closure
      use as a parameter and return value? The <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> type has
      a <kbd>String</kbd> as the key and can have any data as the value. 
      That way different commands can receive different kinds of data.
    </p>
        <p>
      We have already worked with data of Type <kbd>Any</kbd> and used 
      <kbd>as?</kbd> to pull the underlying data Type back out if it is there. 
      Each closure would use <kbd>as?</kbd> to try to pull the parameters it 
      expects out of the <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
      The keys in the <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> would contain the parameter 
      names and the values would be the value for those parameters. For example, 
      suppose the closure would expect parameters like:
        <p>
      <pre><code class="Swift">(fileName: “myFile.txt”, charsToRead: 40)</code></pre>
          <p>
        then the <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> that would be the actual parameter 
        would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="Swift">(data: [“fileName” : “myFile.txt”, “charsToRead” : 40])</code></pre>
          <p>
      Inside the closure you would need code like this:
      <pre><code class="Swift">guard let fileName = data[“filename”] as? String else { handle error }
guard let charsToRead = data[“charsToRead”] as? Int else { handle error }</code></pre>
            <p>
      This is a bit more overhead at the start of the closure, but it allows 
      each closure in the CommandDictionary to receive its own unique
      list of parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
      When we set up a command parser, we can define a function that is called 
      to load each command key with a closure into a <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd> we could 
      call <kbd>commands</kbd>. As mentioned, we also have an enum Type of possible Error 
      Codes (plus one for .success) called <kbd>StatusMessages</kbd>. With those assumptions
      our execution engine look like this:
<pre><code class="Swift">func handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:DataDictionary)
        -> (StatusMessages,DataDictionary?) {    guard let aCommandFunction = commands[aCommand] else {
        return (.invalidCommand,theData)
    }
    let (message, responseData) = aCommandFunction(theData)
    guard let responseData = responseData, message ==.success else {
        return (message, theData)
    }
    return (.success,theResponseData)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      This allows us to write and test a closure for each command. As 
      mentioned earlier, if there we want to separate the processing of
      commands into three separate phases for each command, we could 
       implement three separate instances of <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd>. 
        Our execution engine would validate that the command has been loaded 
        in all three dictionaries. It would then pass the parameters to the 
        closure in the first one, pass the output from that to the closure in
        the second Dictionary and the output from the second to the third. 
        The output of the third would go back to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any step failed, the other steps would not be executed. And, 
        for example, if a password were validated in the first closure 
        then it would not need to be passed to the other closures, thus 
        reducing the amount of code with visibility to the password.
      </p>

              <h3>Passing Functions or Closures as Parameters</h3>
    <p>
      You've used functions that had other functions as parameters. The
      <kbd>map, filter,</kbd> and <kbd>reduce</kbd>
      functions last week leveraged this concept heavily. But you are not
      limited to being able to do this with Built-in Functions. You can write your own
      functions that do this as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time you want to make your functions more abstract and therefore more
      powerful, you can pass part of the behavior of the function as a
      parameter. If you think about it, the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function
      above does this. It just passes collections of functions or closures
      instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a function as a parameter allows a programmer to decide later, long
      after you've written your function, what some of the behavior of your
      function should be. That way your function can be reused and there will be
      less code duplication in the application.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following is an example that illustrates the principle. In a real 
      application, you should use the <kbd>reduce</kbd> BIF, but let's
      use this example to look at how you could use a closure as a parameter.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="Swift">func doIntegerMath(integers:[Int], initialValue:Int, mathToDo:(Int, Int)->Int) -> Int {
    var accumulator = initialValue
    for integer in integers {
        accumulator = mathToDo(accumulator,integer)
    }
    return accumulator
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      The <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter is a function that has
      two integer parameters and has an integer as it's value. The
      <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter's type declaration ends at the
      <kbd>)</kbd> character that concludes the list of parameters for the
      <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function. The <kbd>-> Int</kbd> characters after
      that indicate the value of the <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how similar <kbd>mathToDo</kbd>'s type declaration is to a regular
      function definition. If it were a function declaration, the only thing
      that would be missing would be the names of the parameters. Please don't
      put parameter names in the declaration of the Type of a closure. 
      Type definitions for closures only list the types of the parameters. 
      You can optionally assign them names in the closure itself or just 
      choose to use $0, $1, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another place we use closures is in processes that do input and output such 
      as reading and writing files and accessing data from the internet.
      We will discuss an example of that, but first we need to review a few 
      other concepts to get ready for that topic.
    </p>
              
              <h3>Enumerations with Associated Values</h3>
              <p>
                You have used Swift <a
                  href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Enumerations.html"
                  target="_blank"
                >enumerations</a
                  > for several weeks now, but there is an additional option we need
                  to discuss that allows enumerations to have extra values of any 
                  types be associated with any or each of the enumeration values.
                  This provides functionality similar to 
                  <kbd>discriminated unions</kbd>, <kbd>tagged unions</kbd>, or 
                  <kbd>variants</kbd> in some other languages. Here is an 
                  example from the Apple documentation that stores the value of 
                  a barcode whether it is a UPC or a QR code:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum Barcode { 
    case upc(Int, Int, Int, Int) 
    case qrCode(String) 
}</code></pre> 
                  <p>
              We can use these just like other enum values, assigning them to 
              constants or variables and even creating an Array of them. This is 
              a way that an Array can seem to have values of different types. All 
              would be of the same enum type, but they each can have different 
              associated values included with them. For example:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum Barcode { 
    let barcodes: [Barcode] = [
        .upc(8, 85909, 51226, 3),
        .qrCode("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP")
    ]
}</code></pre> 
<p>
              This is an array of the BarCode type, but the associated values are very different
              from each other. One key use of enumerations with associated values to define error conditions for Swifts approach to error handling.
              </p>

                  <h3>Error Handling in Swift</h3>
                <p>
                You are already familiar with Swifts pattern of handling local 
                errors using <kbd>guard</kbd> statements at the start of functions and 
                loops to protect the code beyond them from invalid or unexpected 
                values. But what about errors that need to be handled beyond that 
                  local scope? Swift support a <a
                    href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/ErrorHandling.html"
                    target="_blank"
                  >do-catch-throw model</a> similar to some other languages to handle those errors.  
                </p>
                  <p>
                    There are four steps to implement do-catch-throw:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Define a type that conform to the <kbd>Error</kbd> protocol. This protocol 
                      does not have any requirements, but indicates the type can be used 
                      for error handling. Enumerations with associated values are a 
                      great option for this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">enum SomeErrorType: Error {
    case oneError
    case anotherError(String)
    case errorWithInts(Int, Int)
}</code></pre>
                    <li>Label a function that can throw an error by adding the keyword 
                      <kbd>throws</kbd> to the function definition, after its parameters 
                      and before the <kbd>-&gt;</kbd> (if it has a return value).</li>
                    <li>Use the keyword <kbd>throw</kbd> to throw an object of a 
                      defined error type like this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">func canThrow() throws -> Int {
    some code
    if error-happens {
        throw SomeErrorType.anotherError(“some string”)
    }
    more code
    return someInt
}</code></pre>
                    <li>When you call a function that can throw errors, call it using 
                      the do-try-catch pattern like this:</li>
<pre><code class="Swift">do {
        let anInt = try canThrow()
    } catch SomeErrorType.oneError {
        handle error
    } catch SomeErrorType.anotherError(let aString) {
        handle error
    } catch errorWithInts(var Int1, Int2) {
        handle error
    } catch {
        handle other error
    }
}</code></pre>
                    </ol>
                  <p>
                    Each phrase after the <kbd>catch</kbd> is a <a
                      href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/ReferenceManual/Patterns.html"
                      target="_blank"
                    >Pattern</a> that usually will be a value ]of the error handling 
                    enumeration Type that you define. Note that if an enumeration value 
                    has associated values, you need to include a let or var placeholder 
                    for them that will be filled in with the values. Those variables or
                    constants can then be used in the code labeled “handle error” above.
                    Also note that you must alway include a generic catch statement at the
                    end to catch any other errors that happen. If those are errors your code
                    cannot deal with you can call throw error in that handler to pass the
                    error for handling further up the call stack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <kbd>catch</kbd> without a pattern will pick up any errors not 
                    listed previously. You could just use <kbd>catch</kbd> without a pattern 
                    to handle all errors. In that case the error message will be 
                    available to your code in a global variable called <kbd>error</kbd>.
                  </p>
                  One other option you can use instead of do-try-catch is to just put 
                  <kbd>try?</kbd> in front of a function call that can throw an error. 
                  In that case, the value of the function will return an optional-wrapped 
                  version of the return value if there is no error. But if an error is 
                  thrown then the function will return nil. This allows you to easily 
                  deal with errors if you don’t need to handle or report on what 
                  went wrong like this:                  <p>
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">guard let anInt = try? canThrow() else {
    report error, then return, continue or break

                  <h3>Data from a Web Site</h3>
                  <p>
                    One common thing we may want to do is retrieve data from a web site. 
                    In Swift, the preferred way to do that in most cases it to use 
                    <kbd>URLSession</kbd>. Here is some code that can do that:
              </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">guard let url = URL(string: "https://someWebSite") else {
    handle error in URL format
}
var result: String = ""
var done = false
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
    (data, response, error) in
    if let anError = error {
        handle error
        done = true
        return
    }
    guard let data = data else { 
        handle unknown error
        done = true
        return
    }
    guard let theResult = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) else { 
      handle error converting data to String
      done = true
      return
    }
    result = theResult
    done = true
}

task.resume()
while !done {
    do something else useful
}
print("Data: \(result)")</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    In this sample code we use <kbd>URLSession</kbd> to create a 
                    <kbd>dataTask</kbd> with a URL and a closure. Swift concurrency 
                    is beyond the scope of this course, but for now you just need to 
                    know that the task it returns will execute concurrently from the 
                    rest of our code and that it is initially in a suspended state. 
                    We call .resume to have it start to do its work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The closure will be called when pulling data from
                    the web site completes or fails. While the task is running, 
                    our main code can do something else. Since both the web access 
                    and  the closure run in a separate task, we need 
                    a way to communicate its completion back to the main code. 
                    We use the variable <kbd>done</kbd> as a simple semaphore to indicate 
                    completion after the closure fills in the String. And we are 
                    careful to not look at nor modify the String or other 
                    variables the closure may affect until <kbd>done</kbd> is true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to <kbd>dataTask</kbd>, <kbd>URLSessions</kbd> can also 
                    use a <kbd>downloadTask</kbd> to download larger amounts of data 
                    from the web to a file, use <kbd>uploadTask</kbd> to send a file 
                    to a web site or use <kbd>streamTask</kbd> to establish a 
                    bidirectional TCP/IP connection. When web sites return smaller 
                    amounts of data like we would use with a <kbd>dataTask</kbd>, 
                    they return the data in JSON format. The sample code above 
                    just converts the entire block of returned data to a String. 
                    But as we will see next, Swift has the capability to 
                    help you parse JSON data into one or more data structures.
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>Decoding JSON Data</h3>
                  <p>
                    <a
                      href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html"
                      target="_blank"
                    >JSON</a> is a standard way for web applications and some other 
                    software to exchange data. Swift has a built-in decoder and 
                    encoder for JSON. Suppose we want to decode some JSON data 
                    that looks like this:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">{"country": "United States",
        "places": [{"longitude": "-122.0152", "latitude": "37.0597"}]}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    First, we would set up a matching struct. In this case, 
                    since there is an Array inside the JSON, we would need 
                    two structs. We mark both as conforming to the <kbd>Codable</kbd> 
                    protocol which will validate that we can use the automatic 
                    conversion like this:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">struct Place: Codable {
    var longitude: String
    var latitude: String
}
struct SomeData: Codable {
    var country: String
    var places: [Place]
}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    Then we create a decoder object and call it passing 
                    the structure and the JSON data.
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">let decoder = JSONDecoder()
do {
    let decoded = try decoder.decode(SomeData.self, from: JSONdata)
    print(decoded)
} catch {
    print("decoder failed: \(error)")
}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    This is a good example of the power of 
                    do-try-catch. If the JSONdata matches the structure 
                    it will be filled in, but if not, then the error 
                    message provides a good indication what went wrong.
                    Note that you do not need to include every field from
                    the JSON data as a property of your struct. If you
                    leave the properties matching some fields out of your
                    struct the decoder will just ignore those fields.
                    Also note that numbers in the JSON data will come in
                    as Strings. The corresponding properties for an Int or
                    Double in the JSON data should be of type String and
                    then you can try to covert them later using Int() or
                    Double().
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Suppose the JSON data has something difficult to 
                    match in a Swift structure like a space in a key 
                    name like this:
                  </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">{"post code": "95066", "country": "United States", 
      "places": [{"place name": "Scotts Valley", "longitude": "-122.0152", 
      "latitude": "37.0597"}]}</code></pre>
                  <p>
                    We can’t really give "post code" a matching property 
                    name with a space in it. One way to address this is that
                    JSON allows us to specify a custom dictionary. That
                    also allows us to do custom mappings if we want to 
                    change names in our data structure from what is in
                    the JSON. We put the dictionary for the custom 
                    mapping as an enum as a property of the structure.
                    The enum is called <kbd>CodingKeys</kbd> that conforms 
                    to both the <kbd>String</kbd> and <kbd>CodingKey</kbd> 
                    protocols. It must contain a case for every property 
                    being decoded. We just list those that stay the same
                    as a case entry with no value, but for those that need 
                    a special mapping we list them explicitly so the class
                    <kbd>SomeData</kbd> looks like this:
<pre><code class="Swift">struct SomeData: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case country
        case postCode = "post code"
        case placeArray = "places"
    }
    var postCode: String
    var country: String
    var placesArray: [Place]
}</code></pre>
                </p>
                  <p>
                This allows "post code" to map to <kbd>postCode</kbd> 
                and also renames “places” to be <kbd>placeArray</kbd>. 
                With this functionality, you can easily decode most 
                JSON data into your own data structures. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                In the previous section, we converted the data 
                from the web site to a String. Now we can use 
                JSONdecoder to decode that web data directly 
                into a structure for use by our application. Putting it
                all together looks like this:
              </p>
<pre><code class="Swift">guard let url = URL(string: "https://someWebSite") else {
    handle error in URL format
}
var JSONdata: Data? = nil
var done = false
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) {
    (data, response, error) in
    if error = error {
        handle web error
        done = true
        return
    }
    guard let data = data else { 
        handle unknown error
        done = true
        return
    }
    JSONdata = data
    done = true
}

task.resume()
while !done {
do something else useful
}

struct Place: Codable {
    var longitude: String
    var latitude: String
}
struct SomeData: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case country
        case postCode = "post code"
        case placeArray = "places"
    }
    var postCode: String
    var country: String
    var placesArray: [Place]
}

do {
    let decoded = try decoder.decode(SomeData.self, from: JSONdata)
    print(decoded)
} catch {
    print("decoder failed: \(error)")
}</code></pre>
