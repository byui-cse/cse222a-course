      <h1>Week 4 Task Instructions</h1>
      <section>
        <h3>Before beginning this Assignment:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure you have read and understood the
            <a href="index.html" target="_blank">reading for the week</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <h1>Your Task</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          Like last week, please download the <a href="tasks.swift">tasks.swift</a> 
          and <a href="main.swift">main.swift</a> files 
          for this weekâ€™s assignment and create a Swift project that contains these
          two files. You should not modify main.swift in any way. 
          Your tasks are in comments in tasks.swift. Each time you successfully 
          compile and run, the test functions in main.swift will test your progress 
          and report which tasks are successfully completed, which are currently 
          failing on or more tests and which are not started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your goal is to write code in tasks.swift so that all tasks are passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first task this week includes implementing the data structures in this UML diagram.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/W4UML1.svg"
            alt="An image showing each of the classes: MedicationContainer, Liquid Medication Container, Tablet Medication Container, and the struct Pharmaceutical Stock Tracker, their properties, and the relationships between them"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Fig.1 - A UML Class and Struct Diagram for the MedicationContainer, LiquidMedicationContainer, 
            TabletMedicationContainer, and PharmaceuticalStockTracker
            classes.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
          This is similar to, but not identical to the UML diagram from last 
          week. Since the test code refers to these classes and struct, the project 
          will not initially compile until you have implemented the necessary data 
          structures as explained in the Task 0 instructions in tasks.swift.
          Note that this week you will not make all the changes shown in the UML
          in Task 0. One change will be done in a later task after we make some
          other adjustments to support it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When all tasks are passing, submit your work in the Canvas system. You should submit two files: your copy of tasks.swift and a screenshot showing successful execution.
        </p>
