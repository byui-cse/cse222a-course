    <h1>Beyond Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things of the
      same type together in a specific order, an array is the way to go. But for
      other situations Arrays are slow. For example, searching in unsorted
      Arrays is uses a \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) algorithm in the best of situations.
      That's way too slow. Let's look at the two other
      <a href="https://swift.org/blog/swift-collections/" target="_blank"
        >Built In Collections (BICs)</a
      >
      Swift has.
    </p>
    <h2>Sets</h2>
    <p>
      Consider a situation where there can only be one copy of any piece of data
      in a collection. Rather than use an Array and do a search-check each time
      you do an insert, way too slow, how about using the collection that is
      designed to handle this for you, and do it much faster.
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set"
        target="_blank"
        >The Set</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a couple of ways you can create a Set. You can, as in the
      snippet below, create an empty set of some specific type and then add
      elements to it and remove elements when you need to.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="JavaScript">var names = Set&lt;String&gt;()
names.insert("Sally")
names.insert("Jose")
names.insert("Sally") //no change. Sally is already there.
names.remove("Jane") //no change. Jane isn't in there.
</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also create a Set while setting its values. The snippet below
      shows you how to do this with three names.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="JavaScript">var names:Set = ["Jane","Sally","Jose"]
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Notice that you have to tell the compiler that the type of collection you
      want is a set. Otherwise it will make it be an array. Also, Sets don't
      guarantee ordering. That's why they can do searching, inserting, and
      removing much faster than an array. If you need things to stay in order,
      remember an array is what you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an extra benefit for selecting Set as your collection type you get to
      use set operations like union, difference, intersection, and symmetric
      difference. There are Built-in Functions (BIFs) for these!
    </p>
    <p>
      One very important thing you must understand is that anything that you put
      into a <kbd>Set</kbd> must be
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable"
        ><kbd>Hashable</kbd></a
      >. This is due to the Set using the hashed value of the elements as a key
      when the value is stored. Ints, Doubles, Strings, and many other built-in
      Swift types are already <kbd>Hashable</kbd>. If you are putting a custom
      element type in a set such as a class, you must
      <a
        href="https://embeddeduse.com/2015/12/30/swift-class-hashable/"
        target="_blank"
        >make the class <kbd>Hashable</kbd></a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
    <p>
      Swift also has a
      <a href="https://www.educba.com/swift-dictionary/" target="_blank"
        >Dictionary BIC</a
      >
      and it works as you might expect based on your use of such things
      previously. It is a key-value store. Just like with Sets, Dictionaries do
      not guarantee ordering. You can also create empty dictionaries and then
      add, remove, and find elements. When you do this you have to indicate the
      type of the key and the type of the value.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="JavaScript">var agesByName = [String:Int]()
agesByName["Sally"] = 21
agesByName["Jose"] = 23
agesByName["Jane"] = 20
</code></pre>

    <p>
      You don't have to declare <kbd>agesByName</kbd> to be a Dictionary in the
      snippet above, the compiler can figure it out. If you want to, you can
      also create and fill or partially fill a dictionary all at once.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var agesByName = ["Sally": 21,"Jose": 23,"Jane":20]
</code></pre>

    <p>
      When you are declaring and filling a Dictionary, you don't even have to
      tell the compiler the key and value types. It can figure that out to.
      However, the key <kbd>Type</kbd> must conform to the
      <kbd>Hashable</kbd> protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many more methods that these and Arrays have that you can use.
      You should take some time and review them. The
      <a
        href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html"
        >Swift documentation</a
      >
      has good descriptions of the methods and how to use them. Go check it out.
      There are also many other types of Collections for different purposes that
      are included in the standard library. You can learn more about some of
      them <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-collections/">here.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Generics</h2>
    <p>
      Even though all the elements in a Collection such as Array, Set or
      Dictionary must be the same type, you are not limited to Collections of
      Int or String, but can choose any type for the elements in your
      Collection. Set elements are constrained to meet the Hashable protocol as
      are Dictionary keys, but that still allows vast flexibility. As with many
      languages, these built in types also have many functions that work
      independent of the types of elements in the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift takes that further and allows you to define your own generic Types
      and functions that can work with many different Types of input or
      elements. Dictionary is an example of a generic Type. It is defined as:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">public struct Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt; where Key : Hashable {…}</code></pre>
    <p>
      “Key” and “Value” refer to two types that are used later in the
      definition. You can see it also has a “where” clause that requires the Key
      type to be Hashable. Later in the definition it creates a typealias that
      is an abbreviation for the elements in the Dictionary:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">public typealias Element = (key: Key, value: Value)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Then it can use Key, Value and Element in defining functions such as
      filter() that can apply the same code for any types used for a specific
      Dictionary:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">public func filter(_ isIncluded: (Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;.Element)-> Bool) -> [Key : Value]</code></pre>
    <p>
      In Swift, you are not limited to the built-in generic types, but can
      define your own generic types, functions and other language elements so
      you don’t need to rewrite code that would be the same for each different
      type.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Collections</h2>
    <p>
      Let's revisit the pharmacy tracker from week 03. The model class
      <kbd>PharmaceuticalStockTracker</kbd> had an Array of
      <kbd>Medications</kbd> that it used to keep track of how many bottles,
      bags, etc. of medications were in stock. It did this by having each
      instance of <kbd>Medication</kbd> represent a bottle, bag, of medicine
      stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a problem with that design. It's the amount of time it takes
      to find medication in the system. Ah... It sounds like Array was the wrong
      choice. If we used a Dictionary of Arrays of Medications, that would solve
      the finding problem and still let us keep multiple bottles or bags of
      medication of a single type in the tracking system.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what would the code for that look like? Since the system would need to
      start without any medication being stored, we'd need to create an empty
      Dictionary. The example is in the snippet below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="JavaScript">var inStockMedications = [String:[Medication]]()
</code></pre>

    <p>
      There we go. That's it. The key is a String and the value is an Array of
      Medications. But what would the code look like when medication was
      purchased and needed to be added to the model? Great question. That's part
      of your task this week.
