    <h1>Beyond Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things of the
      same type together in a specific order, an array is the way to go. But for
      other situations Arrays are slow. For example, searching in unsorted
      Arrays uses a \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) algorithm in the best of situations.
      That's way too slow. Let's look at two of the other
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collections"
        target="_blank"
        >Built In Collections (BICs)</a
      >
      Swift has.
    </p>
    <h2>Sets</h2>
    <p>
      Consider a situation where there can only be one copy of any piece of data
      in a collection. You could use an Array and do a search-check each time
      you do an insert, but that is way too slow. You can instead use the collection
      that is designed to handle this for you and to do it much faster:
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set"
        target="_blank"
        >the Set</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways you can create a Set. You can, as in the
      code below, create an empty set of some specific type and then add
      and remove elements as needed. In specifying the type, the part
      inside the &lt; &gt; indicates the type of objects stored in the Set.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var names = Set&lt;String&gt;()
names.insert("Sally")
names.insert("Jose")
names.insert("Sally") //no change. Sally is already there.
names.remove("Jane") //no change. Jane isn't in there.
</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also create a Set while setting its values. The snippet below
      shows you how to do this with three names.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var names:Set = ["Jane","Sally","Jose"]
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Notice that you must tell the compiler that the type of collection you
      want is a set. Otherwise, it will create an array. Also, Sets don't
      guarantee ordering. That's why they can do searching, inserting, and
      removing much faster than an array. If you need things to stay in order,
      an array is what you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an extra benefit for selecting Set as your collection type you get to
      use set operations like union, difference, intersection, and symmetric
      difference. There are Built-in Functions (BIFs) for these!
    </p>
    <p>
      One very important thing you must understand is that anything that you put
      into a <kbd>Set</kbd> must be
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable"
        target="_blank"
        ><kbd>Hashable</kbd></a
      >. This is due to the Set using the hashed value of the elements as a key
      when the value is stored. Ints, Doubles, Strings, and many other built-in
      Swift types are already <kbd>Hashable</kbd>. If you are putting objects
      of a custom type such as a class or struct into a Set, you must
      make the class <kbd>Hashable</kbd>. In this week's assignment, you
      will need to make objects of a custom type Hashable
      so you can put objects of that type into a Set. You do that by marking
      the type definition as complying with the <kbd>Hashable</kbd> protocol
      and then implementing whatever is needed to comply with the protocol.
      As we mentioned last week, the official documentation for any built-in
      protocol includes an explanation of the way or ways to comply with that
      protocol. So when you do the assignment, follow the link to that protocol.
    </p>
    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
    <p>
      Swift also has a
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary" target="_blank"
        >Dictionary built-in type</a
      >
      and it works as you might expect based on your use of such things
      previously. In some other languages these are referred to as Maps. 
      Dictionaries are key-value stores. Just as with Sets, Dictionaries do
      not guarantee ordering. You can also create empty dictionaries and then
      add, remove, and find elements. When you create a Dictionary this you
      must indicate the type of the key and the type of the value.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var agesByName = [String:Int]()
agesByName["Sally"] = 21
agesByName["Jose"] = 23
agesByName["Jane"] = 20
</code></pre>

    <p>
      You could specify a dictionary type like <kbd>Dictionary&lt;String, Int&gt;</kbd>
      which tells the compiler that you want a Dictionary with a String key and an Int value.
      But you don't need to declare <kbd>agesByName</kbd> to be a Dictionary in the
      code above, the compiler can figure it out by the <kbd>:</kbd> between the key 
      and the value type. You can also create and fill or partially fill a dictionary 
      all at once by listing the <kbd>key:value</kbd> pairs.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var agesByName = ["Sally": 21,"Jose": 23,"Jane":20]
</code></pre>

    <p>
      When you are declaring and filling a Dictionary, you don't even need to
      tell the compiler the key and value types. It can figure that out to.
      However, the key type must conform to the <kbd>Hashable</kbd> protocol.
    </p>
        <p>
          To access an element of a Dictionary, you write code similar to accessing
          an element of an Array.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="Swift">var anAge = agesByName["Sally"]</code></pre>
        <p>
          One difference from an Array is that what you put inside the
          [ ] is of the type you specified for the key. For an Array the index
          is always an integer from 0 to one below the size of the array (that you can
          find out by using the <kbd>.count</kbd> computed property). Another difference
          is that the value returned by looking something up in a Dictionary is an
          Optional. That is because the way the language lets you know that the
          requested dictionary entry does not exist is to return a value of nil.
          So you will need to use the standard methods you learned in week 2 to
          unwrap the Optional such as these two examples:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="Swift">guard var anAge = agesByName["Sally"] else {
    <i>// handle case where "Sally" is not in the Dictionary"</i>
}
<i>// handle case where "Sally" is in the Dictionary</i></code></pre>
        <pre><code class="Swift">if let ageConstant = agesByName["Jose"] {
    <i>// handle case where "Jose" is in the Dictionary</i>
} else {
    <i>// handle case where "Jose" is not in the Dictionary"</i>
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      There are many more methods that you can use with Sets, Dictionaries 
      and Arrays. You should take some time and review them. The
      <a
        href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/collectiontypes/"
        target="_blank"
        >Swift documentation</a
      >
      has good descriptions of the methods and how to use them. Go check it out.
      There are also other types of Collections for different purposes that
      are included in the standard library or in an standard add-on package called
      <kbd>Collections</kbd>. You can learn more about some of
      them <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-collections/" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>

        <p>
          Note that while you can iterate over Sets, Dictionaries and Arrays 
          with a for-in loop, Arrays have a definite order while the elements 
          of Dictionaries and Arrays may come back in any order. If you use a 
          for-in loop with a Dictionary, the element value for each loop is a 
          tuple like this:
        </p>
        
<pre><code class="Swift">for (aKey, aValue) in aDictionary { loop actions }
</code></pre>
        <p>
        You can also iterate over just the keys or just the values like this:
        </p>
        
<pre><code class="Swift">for aKey in aDictionary.keys { loop actions }
for aValue in aDictionary.values { loop actions }</code></pre>

        <p>
          When you write code using a Dictionary, you can loop over all of the
          elements or keys or both if you need to. However, if you need to access
          or modify a specific element, it would waste the efficiency of a
          Dictionary to loop through the Dictionary to find that element. Instead
          you should just access the element directly like the following. Note that
          if a value exists with the key "Jane" this code will update the value. If
          there is no existing key "Jane" this code will create a new key-value pair.
          And remember that <kbd>ageForJane</kbd> will be an Optional.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="Swift">agesByName["Jane"] = 42
let ageForJane = agesByName["Jane"]</code></pre>
    <h2>Applications of Collections</h2>
    <p>
      Let's revisit the application for a pharmacy to track containers of
      medications in inventory. Previously we created a class
      <kbd>PharmaceuticalStockTracker</kbd> that had Array of
      <kbd>Medications</kbd>, used to keep track of how many bottles,
      bags, etc. of medications were in stock. It does this by having each
      instance of <kbd>Medication</kbd> represent a bottle or bag, of medicine
      stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a problem with that design: the amount of time it takes
      to find medication in the system. It sounds like Array may have been the
      wrong choice. If we used a Dictionary of Arrays of Medications, that would
      solve the finding problem and still let us keep multiple bottles or bags
      of medication of a single type in the tracking system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose further that we want to make sure we do not accidentally add an
      object representing a specific container of medication to the stock tracker
      multiple times. We don't want to think we have several containers when in fact
      we accidentally have several copies of the same object representing a single
      actual container of medication. We could make sure to check for that every
      time we add a medication, but we can use the Set Type to make sure there is
      only one copy of each medication container object in our inventory.
      
      But what would the code for that look like? Since the system would need to
      start without any medication being stored, would create an empty
      Dictionary that has Sets of MedicationContainers as values like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="swift">var inStockMedications = [String:Set&lt;MedicationContainer&gt;]()</code></pre>

    <p>
      The key is a String and the value is a Set of MedicationContainers. 
      But what would the code look like when medication was purchased
      and needed to be added to the model? Great question. That's part
      of your assignment this week that will give you some experience with
                Sets and Dictionaries, plus continuing to use the things
                we learned in previous weeks.
