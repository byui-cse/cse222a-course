    <h1>Beyond Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things of the
      same type together in a specific order, an array is the way to go. But for
      other situations Arrays are slow. For example, searching in unsorted
      Arrays is uses a \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) algorithm in the best of situations.
      That's way too slow. Let's look at two of the other
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collections"
        target="_blank"
        >Built In Collections (BICs)</a
      >
      Swift has.
    </p>
    <h2>Sets</h2>
    <p>
      Consider a situation where there can only be one copy of any piece of data
      in a collection. Rather than use an Array and do a search-check each time
      you do an insert, way too slow, how about using the collection that is
      designed to handle this for you, and to do it much faster.
      <a
        href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set"
        target="_blank"
        >The Set</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several ways you can create a Set. You can, as in the
      snippet below, create an empty set of some specific type and then add
      elements to it and remove elements when you need to.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var names = Set&lt;String&gt;()
names.insert("Sally")
names.insert("Jose")
names.insert("Sally") //no change. Sally is already there.
names.remove("Jane") //no change. Jane isn't in there.
</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can also create a Set while setting its values. The snippet below
      shows you how to do this with three names.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var names:Set = ["Jane","Sally","Jose"]
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Notice that you must tell the compiler that the type of collection you
      want is a set. Otherwise, it will make it be an array. Also, Sets don't
      guarantee ordering. That's why they can do searching, inserting, and
      removing much faster than an array. If you need things to stay in order,
      remember an array is what you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an extra benefit for selecting Set as your collection type you get to
      use set operations like union, difference, intersection, and symmetric
      difference. There are Built-in Functions (BIFs) for these!
    </p>
    <p>
      One very important thing you must understand is that anything that you put
      into a <kbd>Set</kbd> must be
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/hashable"
        ><kbd>Hashable</kbd></a
      >. This is due to the Set using the hashed value of the elements as a key
      when the value is stored. Ints, Doubles, Strings, and many other built-in
      Swift types are already <kbd>Hashable</kbd>. If you are putting a custom
      element type in a set such as a class, you must
      <a
        href="https://embeddeduse.com/2015/12/30/swift-class-hashable/"
        target="_blank"
        >make the class <kbd>Hashable</kbd></a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
    <p>
      Swift also has a
      <a href="https://www.educba.com/swift-dictionary/" target="_blank"
        >Dictionary BIC</a
      >
      and it works as you might expect based on your use of such things
      previously. In some other languages these are referred to as Maps. 
      Dictionaries are key-value stores. Just like with Sets, Dictionaries do
      not guarantee ordering. You can also create empty dictionaries and then
      add, remove, and find elements. When you do this you must indicate the
      type of the key and the type of the value.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var agesByName = [String:Int]()
agesByName["Sally"] = 21
agesByName["Jose"] = 23
agesByName["Jane"] = 20
</code></pre>

    <p>
      You don't need to declare <kbd>agesByName</kbd> to be a Dictionary in the
      snippet above, the compiler can figure it out by the <kbd>:</kbd> between the key 
      and the value. You can also create and fill or partially fill a dictionary 
      all at once by listing the key : value pairs.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">var agesByName = ["Sally": 21,"Jose": 23,"Jane":20]
</code></pre>

    <p>
      When you are declaring and filling a Dictionary, you don't even need to
      tell the compiler the key and value types. It can figure that out to.
      However, the key <kbd>Type</kbd> must conform to the
      <kbd>Hashable</kbd> protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many more methods that you can use with Sets, Dictionaries 
      and Arrays. You should take some time and review them. The
      <a
        href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/CollectionTypes.html"
        >Swift documentation</a
      >
      has good descriptions of the methods and how to use them. Go check it out.
      There are also other types of Collections for different purposes that
      are included in the standard library or in an standard add-on package called
      <kbd>Collections</kbd>. You can learn more about some of
      them <a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-collections/">here.</a>
    </p>

        <p>
          Note that while you can iterate over Sets, Dictionaries and Arrays 
          with a for-in loop, Arrays have a definite order while the elements 
          of Dictionaries and Arrays may come back in any order. If you use a 
          for-in loop with a Dictionary, the element value for each loop is a 
          tuple like this:
        </p>
        
<pre><code class="Swift">for (aKey, aValue) in aDictionary { loop actions }
</code></pre>
        <p>
        You can also iterate over just the keys or just the values like this:
        </p>
        
<pre><code class="Swift">for aKey in aDictionary.keys { loop actions }
for aValue in aDictionary.values { loop actions }
</code></pre>
        
    <h2>Generics</h2>
    <p>
      Even though all the elements in a Collection such as Array, Set or
      Dictionary must be the same type, you are not limited to Collections of
      Int or String, but can choose any type for the elements in your
      Collection. Set elements are constrained to meet the Hashable protocol as
      are Dictionary keys, but that still allows vast flexibility. As with many
      languages, these built-in types also have many functions that work
      independent of the types of elements in the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift takes that further and allows you to define your own generic Types
      and functions that can work with many different Types of input or
      elements. Dictionary is an example of a generic Type. It is defined as:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">public struct Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt; where Key : Hashable {…}</code></pre>
    <p>
      “Key” and “Value” refer to two types that are used later in the
      definition. You can see it also has a “where” clause that requires the Key
      type to be Hashable. Later in the definition it creates a typealias that
      is an abbreviation for the elements in the Dictionary:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">public typealias Element = (key: Key, value: Value)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Then it can use Key, Value and Element in defining functions such as
      filter() that can apply the same code for any types used for a specific
      Dictionary:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Swift">public func filter(_ isIncluded: (Dictionary&lt;Key, Value&gt;.Element)-> Bool) -> [Key : Value]</code></pre>
    <p>
      In Swift, you are not limited to the built-in generic types, but can
      define your own generic types, functions and other language elements so
      you don't need to rewrite code that would be the same for each different
      type.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications of Collections</h2>
    <p>
      Let's revisit the application for a pharmacy to track containers of
      medications in inventory. Previously we created a class
      <kbd>PharmaceuticalStockTracker</kbd> that had Array of
      <kbd>Medications</kbd>, used to keep track of how many bottles,
      bags, etc. of medications were in stock. It does this by having each
      instance of <kbd>Medication</kbd> represent a bottle or bag, of medicine
      stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a problem with that design: the amount of time it takes
      to find medication in the system. It sounds like Array may have been the
      wrong choice. If we used a Dictionary of Arrays of Medications, that would
      solve the finding problem and still let us keep multiple bottles or bags
      of medication of a single type in the tracking system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose further that we want to make sure we do not accidentally add an
      object representing a specific container of medication to the stock tracker
      multiple times. We don't want to think we have several containers when in fact
      we accidentally have several copies of the same object representing a single
      actual container of medication. We could make sure to check for that every
      time we add a medication, but we can use the Set Type to make sure there is
      only one copy of each medication container object in our inventory.
      
      But what would the code for that look like? Since the system would need to
      start without any medication being stored, would create an empty
      Dictionary that has Sets of MedicationContainers as values like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="swift">var inStockMedications = [String:Set&lt;MedicationContainer&gt;]()</code></pre>

    <p>
      The key is a String and the value is a Set of MedicationContainers. 
      But what would the code look like when medication was purchased
      and needed to be added to the model? Great question. That's part
      of your assignment this week. But first let’s cover a few more things  
      you will need to know about.
    </p>
        <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

        <p>
          You may often want to use Regular Expressions to match patterns in text. 
          If you are not familiar with Regular Expressions, there are many good 
          resources on the internet. In Swift, when you want to write a string
          with a Regular Expression in it, you would need to use <kbd>\</kbd>
          to "escape" the meaning of many special characters. One way to
          simplify this is to put a <kbd>#</kbd> outside both sides 
          of a quoted String like this:
        </p>
<pre><code class="swift">#" a(.*)b"#</code></pre>
            <p>
            Swift will then ignore the special meaning of any special
          characters in the string.
            </p>
          <p>
            To try to match a regular expression, use the 
            <kbd>range(of:options:)</kbd> method on a String object. 
            Use the regular expression as the <kbd>of:</kbd> parameter 
            and  <kbd>.regularExpression</kbd> as the <kbd>options:</kbd> 
            parameter. This will return a matching substring if there is a 
            match or nil if not. For example:

<pre><code class="swift">aString.range(of: #"\d{3}[-]\d{3}[-]\d{4}"#, options: .regularExpression)</code></pre>
            <p>will return a substring that matches a US Phone number
              patten if there is one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that the above regular expression will provide a non-nil 
              result if there is a phone number inside aString so it will 
              match on “x123-456-7890” or “123-456-7890-11111”. If you 
              want an exact match you would need to either compare the 
              result of the search to the original String to see if the
              match is the full string or else use <kbd>^</kbd> and 
              <kbd>$</kbd> to indicate that you want your comparison 
              to match the full string. This example:
<pre><code class="swift">aString.range(of: #"^\d{3}[-]\d{3}[-]\d{4}$"#, options: .regularExpression)</code></pre>
              <p>
                will return a substring (if there is one) that exactly matches 
                a US Phone number patten with no extra characters in the string.
              </p>
              <p>
                The assignment this week will give you some experience with
                Sets and Dictionaries, regular expressions
                and generics, plus continuing to use the things
                we learned in previous weeks.
