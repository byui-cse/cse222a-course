		<h1>Your Task</h1>
		<section>
			<h3>Before beginning this Task:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Make sure you have read and understood the <a href="../week03/" target="_blank">reading for the week</a>.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<h4>Situation</h4>
		<p>
			You are working for a company that needs a technology solution to determine how many of what types of programmers they need to hire. They have data in a database that contains all pertinent information regarding all employees for the company. The company also has a series of rules that apply to programmers and their development leads. They are;
			<ol>
				<li>No programmer can have more than two teammates.</li>
				<li>The type the managers being tracked in the data set is a Development Lead.</li>
				<li>Development leads can manage no more than 15 programmers and no less than 3.</li>
				<li>All programmer teammates must be managed by the same development lead.</li>
				<li>Each programmer must have at least one teammate that has worked for the company for more than 1 year and has at least 5 years experience.</li>
				<li>No programmer can be a member of more than one team.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Using classes, design and create a code set that indicates what types of programmers are needed to meet the criteria above. Use classes and apply only IS_A inheritance.

			You will not have access to the employee database, so to test your application the Quality Assurance group has asked that you generate a testing data set to run your code against. this data set is to consist of 52 development leads and between 120 and 125 programmers. You are instructed to create the data set in such a way that the experience constraint is violated. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of the code set required by your employers, 
			<ul>
				<li>create a function that assigns programmers to development leads based on the criteria stated, and </li>
				<li>create a function using the result of the assignment function. Name this function <kbd>generateNeededHires</kbd>. It must return data describing the types of programmers that need to be hired.</li>
		</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Task 2</h3>
			<p>
				Recreate your solution for Task 1 using classes but this time use only HAS_A type inheritance.
			</p>
		</section>

			<h3>Task 3</h3>
			<p>
				Recreate your solution for Task 1 using structures. This time choose between using either or both IS_A and HAS_A inheritance. Use your best judgment to make these decisions.
			</p>

			<h3>Review</h3>
			<h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
			<ol>
	          <li>Review one of the many <a href="provided_solution.zip">possible solutions</a> for this task,</li>
	          <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solution's code, and</li>
	          <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
			</ol>
