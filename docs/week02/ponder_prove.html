        <h3>Before beginning this Assignment:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure you have reviewed the
            <a href="../week01/index.html" target="_blank"
              >Installation and Purpose</a
            >
            and <a href="index.html" target="_blank">The Fundamentals</a> course
            content.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          Please download the <a download href="tasks.swift">tasks.swift</a> and
          <a download href="main.swift">main.swift</a> files for this weekâ€™s
          assignment and create a Swift project that contains these two files.
          You should not modify main.swift in any way. You should be able to
          successfully compile the two files. When the project runs it will
          print a message to the console saying that 10 tasks are not started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your assigned tasks are commented in tasks.swift. Follow the
          instructions for each task and implement code to make it work. Each
          time you successfully compile and run your program, main.swift will
          test your progress and report which tasks are successfully completed,
          which are currently failing, and which tests have not been started.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a task fails, the test code will also provide some diagnostic
          information about what may have gone wrong or at least what was
          different between what your code did and what the test code expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your goal is to write code in tasks.swift so that all tasks are
          passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When all tasks are passing, submit your work in Canvas. You should
          submit two files: your copy of tasks.swift and a screenshot showing
          successful execution.
        </p>
