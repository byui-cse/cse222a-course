        <h3>Before beginning this Assignment:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure you have reviewed the
            <a href="../week01/index.html" target="_blank"
              >Installation and Purpose</a
            >
            and <a href="index.html" target="_blank">The Fundamentals</a> course
            content.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          Please download the <a download href="tasks.swift">tasks.swift</a> and
          <a download href="main.swift">main.swift</a> files for this weekâ€™s
          assignment and create a Swift project that contains these two files.
          You should not modify main.swift in any way. You should be able to
          successfully compile the two files. When the project runs it will
          print a message to the console saying that 9 tasks are not started.
        </p>
        <p>
          The file main.swift must keep that exact name. You can rename tasks.swift
          if you choose, but main.swift must have exactly that name. If the computer
          renames it main1.swift, for example, you must change it to main.swift in
          the project folder or the project will not compile correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using XCode on a Macintosh, after you put the two files into
          the project source folder, you need to go to the File menu in XCode and
          choose "Add Files" and add the files to the project. ON the Mac, even if
          they are in the right folder, files like "tasks.swift" will not be compiled
          as part of the project unless you use that menu to add them to the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your assigned tasks are commented in tasks.swift. Follow the
          instructions for each task and implement code to make it work. Each
          time you successfully compile and run your program, main.swift will
          test your progress and report which tasks are successfully completed,
          which are currently failing, and which tests have not been started.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a task fails, the test code will also provide some diagnostic
          information about what may have gone wrong or at least what was
          different between what your code did and what the test code expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your goal is to write code in tasks.swift so that all tasks are
          passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When all tasks are passing, submit your work in Canvas. You should
          submit two files: your copy of tasks.swift and a screenshot showing
          successful execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have difficulty, review your code carefully and review
          this week's reading. You can post questions to the Teams General
          channel for the course. If you cannot complete some Tasks, ask the
          instructor for help or extra time. Do not submit an incomplete
          assignment. One hint: if you ask the instructor for help,
          send two things to the instructor along with the request:
          <ol>
            <li>the <u>exact wording</u> of the error message you are seeing</li>
            <li>a copy of the current tasks.swift (you can either email the file or paste
              just the difficult function into a teams Chat with the instructor).</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
