      <h1>Some Similarities and Differences</h1>
      <h3>Shared Operators</h3>
      <p>
        Remember, both Python and JavaScript have C as one of their ancestors.
        Because of this, it is not shocking to find out that they share some of
        the same C-type operators. These include +, -, /, *, ==, !=, &lt, &gt,
        etc. By going to these two sites, you can compare the operators for the
        two languages.

          >Swift's list of operators</a> or, for a more detailed description, <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html">this list</a>. When you do so, you will find that Python has a few that Swift
        does not and that Swift has a few that Python does not. You will also see that the conditional operators, also known
        as logical operators, exist in both languages but use different
        characters.
      </p>
      <h3>JavaScript's missing operators</h3>
      <p>
        Because Python and JavaScript are different languages and the creators
        of JavaScript had different opinions than those who created Python,
        there are some Python operators you should not expect to find in
        JavaScript. They are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>// - the floor division operator</li>
        <li>&lt&gt - an alternative to !=</li>
        <li>**= - the exponent and assign operator</li>
        <li>and - the logical and operator</li>
        <li>or - the locical or operator</li>
        <li>not - the logical not operator</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Don't get the wrong idea. Each of these behaviors can be done in
        JavaScript, they will just be done a little differently. Take a look at
        Table 1 to see how.
      </p>

          <tr>
            <td>a//b</td>

          <tr>
            <td>a &lt&gt b</td>
            <td>a != b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a**=b</td>
            <td>a = pow(a,b) (for floating point type numbers a and b)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a and b</td>
            <td>a && b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>a or b</td>
            <td>a || b</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>not(a and b)</td>
            <td>!(a && b)</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>
        Remember, Swift has
        <a
          href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html"
          target="_blank"
          >other operators</a
        >
        available as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Variables</h3>
      <p>
        In Python, a variable can hold any type of value and can change the type
        of value it holds. For example, this code is valid in Python.
      </p>
      <pre>
<code class="Python">age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2
age = 'old'</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        Swift has both variables and constants. Unlike in Python,
        they can hold only one type and that type can not change. In Swift you use the 
        var keyword to declare a variable. Like this:
      </p>
      <p>
      <pre>
<code class="Swift">var age = 3
age = 5
age = 4.2//compilation failure, type change
age = 'old'//compilation failure, type change</code>
	</pre>
  </p>
    <p>
      Swift uses what is called <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interpolate" target="_blank">'interpolation'</a> 
      to figure out the type of the variable. In the code above, the compiler 
      discovered that the variable age is of type Integer because 3 is an Integer and inserted the keyword Integer into the compiled code. 
      In the code snippet below, the compiler 
      discovers that the height variable is of type Double because 3.25 is a Double.
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre>
<code class="Swift">var height = 3.25
height = 4.2
height = 4//compilation failure, type change
age = 'tall'//compilation failure, type change</code>
  </pre>
  </p>
      <h3>Constants</h3>
      <p>In Python, Constants are declared using an all upper case name</p>

      <pre>
<code class="Python">PI=3.14</code>
	</pre>
      <p>
        In Swift this is done differently. Instead of using all upper case
        names, Swift requires the use of the let keyword. Like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
<code>let pi = 3.14</code>
	</pre>
      <p>

          >Swift Variables - var vs. let explained</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also possible, and sometimes desireable, to tell the Swift compiler the type of a variable 
        instead of allowing it to interpolate it. You can do this with any <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/swift/swift_variables.htm">basic Swift type</a>. 
        For example, 
              <pre>
<code>let pi:Float = 3.14</code>
  </pre>
      creates a constant called pi of type Float, a floating point number that uses fewer bytes of RAM than a variable of type Double. Also, 
       <pre>
<code>var name:String = "Sue"</code>
  </pre>
      creates a variable called 'name' of type String and sets the value to be Sue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Swift has something analogous the Python's None. In Swift it is nil. Declaring the type of a variable is required if the variable is initialized to nil. 
        Think about this for a minute and take a look at this code snippet. 
        <pre>
<code>var city = nil</code>
  </pre>
        Here, the compiler can't interpolate a type for the city variable because nil has no type! That code won't compile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, Swift will require you to add in the type. You might think, based on previous programming experience, that this code snippet would compile 
        <pre>
<code>var city:String = nil</code>
  </pre>
        but that would also be incorrect. This code will also fail to compile and you will get an error message that includes a '?' character. This is 
        because Swift is designed to be safer than other languages you may have used. Instead, you would need a varable that is an 'optional' type.
      </p>
      <h3>Optionals</h3>
      <p>
        In Swift, variables of type optional are either nil, or are wrappers around regular variable types. For example, this code snippet
        <pre>
<code>var city:String? = nil</code>
  </pre>
       reads, in English, like this. "Create a variable called city of type String optional and set it to nil." If you later figure out what the city 
       variable should be set to, you can have the city variable wrap a value by doing something simillar to this.
        <pre>
<code>city = "Kinshasa"</code>
  </pre>
      The compiler takes care of all the wrapping up of the string Kinshasa in the String optional for you. You don't need to add any extra code. After 
      assigning "Kinshasa" to the String optional city, the city String optional now is wrapped around the String "Kinshasa".
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have a String optional and want to get the string back out, you use the '!' operator. Be careful! If you try this
  <pre>        
<code>print(city!)</code>
  </pre>
       and city is nil, you will get a runtime failure with a message saying that an unexpected nil was found. These optionals come in VERY handy and it is EASY 
       to check to see if something is nil using optionals. Take a look at the following snippet.

  <pre>        
<code>print(city ?? "Unknown")</code>
  </pre>
      This code prints "Unknown" if the String optional city is nil, or the value wrapped by the String optional if city is not nil. this is due to the 
      nil-coalescing operator, ??. That's its job. In this case, Kinshasa is printed out since city is not nil.
      </p>
      <h3>Wrap Up</h3>

      <p>
        As with all things, there are pluses and minuses of requiring keywords
        like const and let and having or not having some operators. One
        disadvantage of requiring let and const is the extra cluttering of the
        code with 'unnecessary' words. An advantage is explicitness. Everyone
        that later reads your code will know exactly what you meant to have
        happen. Also, because of this explicitness, a variable can't be
        accidentally declared twice in JavaScript, a situation which can produce
        strange, difficult to debug, bad behavior in large Python code sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which operator set to use in a language often depends on the languages
        the language create likes and dislikes. Perhaps the creators of Python
        thought the syntax of Structured Query Language (SQL) was easier to
        understand and so they adopted its and, or, and not operators. This is
        opinion and as such it and the alternative C operators used in
        JavaScript, &&, ||, !, are just as valid. Don't get caught up in the
        psuedo-religious ferver that some programmers adopt. Every language is
        good at some things and bad at others. This includes both Python and
        JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h1>Arrays</h1>
      <p>In JavaScript, arrays can be declared like this.</p>
      <pre><code>
let names = ['Bob','Sue','Jorge','Svetlana']
	</code></pre>
      <p>This should look very familiar to you.</p>
      <p>You access elements of an array like this</p>
      <pre><code>
let aName = names[0]
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        with zero being the index of the first element in the array. Modifying
        values in the array is doable also.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
names[2]='George'
	</code></pre>
      <p>Now the third element of the array is George instead of Jorge.</p>
      <p>
        JavaScript has a lot of Built in Functions(BIF's) that you can use to
        modify arrays. Imagine you needed to use an array to keep track of
        customers lined up to see a movie. As people show up, they need to line
        up in the order they arrived. You can simulate this using the push
        method of array.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Bob, Sue, George, and Svetlana were already waiting in line for the
        show in that order, and then Grace showed up too, you would use push to
        add Grace at the end of the array (the back of the line).
      </p>
      <pre><code>
names.push('Grace')
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        Print the updated names array to the console and you see Grace added on
        the end.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
console.log(names)//Displays ['Bob','Sue','George','Svetlana','Grace']
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        Since you can add elements to the end of the array, surely there is a
        way to remove elements from the end of the array. You do this with the
        pop method.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <pre><code>
names.pop()
console.log(names)//Displays ['Bob','Sue','George','Svetlana']
	</code></pre>
      <p>
        Can you remove elements from the end or add them to the beginning of the
        array? You bet. There are a large number of BIF's that
        <a

          target="_blank"
        >
          you can apply to array</a
        >. Check them out. Also, you'll be learning about using filter, sort,
        map, and reduce array BIF's next week.
