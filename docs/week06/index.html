    <h1>A Project</h1>
    <p>
      Now it's time to combine what you've been learning with what you have been
      learning in your classes for your major. Brainstorm and create a small
      project that may take about three hours to complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your interests should drive the selection of what you do for this project.
      Selecting something interesting to you will aid you in completing the
      project and doing it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the purpose of this project is to demonstrate some of what you have
      learned in this course, your project is expected to correctly use some
      Optionals and at least one guard statement. It must also include use of
      at least 5 of the following 10 things you learned about in the course:
        <ul>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Dictionaries</li>
        <li>Sets</li>
        <li>Enumerations</li>
        <li>Closures</li>
        <li>Structs</li>
        <li>Classes and Child Classes</li>
        <li>Tuples</li>
        <li>Protocols</li>
        <li>Do-Catch-Throw error handling</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If your project has a user interface with interaction of any kind with the user,
      then when it starts it needs to print instructions to the user that are clear
      and complete enough that the instructor or another user can operate your project
      fully without needing to decipher your code. For example, it should tell the user
      what commands they can type, how they can parameterize them, how they exit, etc.
      Make sure you guard against any unexpected user input cases. A major aspect of Swift
      is protecting against errors due to unexpected data. If a user can crash the program
      or get majorly unexpected behavior by putting in invalid user data entry, you will
      be asked to correct your project. Also, while this is not a GUI
      class, but you all are experienced enough to be able to think through how a
      person would use your project coming to it without any guidance or training.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do try to take a swift-like approach using somne things should have been picked up as
      you did your weekly assignments about Swift standard practices. We do expect you to do
      things in object oriented ways where possible. For example, if you have an struct or
      class defined and it would be useful in your code to have that object provide some kind
      of count of things inside the object, then please implement a "count" computed value
      and use that in your code. We are not talking about providing a count object in an
      Array or Dictionary since those have a built in count computed property. But if for
      example, your struct or class type contains an array of objects
      as one of its properties, an object of that struct type will not automatically
      have a count property, but you may want to define one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you create a struct or class of which you will want to print the contents, please
      look at the task 7 in week 3 and see if you could comply with CustomStringConvertible.
      Suppose you have an array of objects of that struct or class called anArray. If you
      define a computed String "description" property for that struct or class that describes
      an object of that type and if you mark that you comply with
      CustomStringConvertible, then you can print the contents of that array like this:
      <pre><code>for anObject in anArray { print(anObject) }</code></pre>
      That will print the contents of each Array element in whatever format the object specifies.
      It is much cleaner to have the object define for itself how it is to be printed or described
      in a String.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, it is best practice to have any strings you present the user to be in
      constants so you can edit them in a standard place or localize all the strings to a
      different language, I am not requiring localization, etc. in these projects. However,
      if you present a list of menu options like this for example:
      <pre><code>print("1: Menu option")
print("2: Menu option")
print("3: Menu option")
print("4: Menu option")
print("5: Exit")</code></pre>
      I would ask that instead you put the Strings into an Array and loop through that array
      to print and work with the menu options instead of hard wiring the strings into print
      statements. You could be even more fancy and use something like enums that have
      String values where, supposing the Array of menu options was called menuStrings,
      you could use something like "menuStrings[i].first" to pull out the first character
      of a menu to compare to the user input. At minimum, if you print a list of strings
      like a menu, do it from an Array or Dictionary of strings.
