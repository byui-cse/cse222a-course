      <h1>Your Tasks</h1>
      <h2>Task 1</h2>
      <h3>Setup Your Environment and Explore It</h3>
      <p>
        You will be setting up your machines to write command-line applications.
        This is a language course, not a platform course. There is a mobile
        development course that you can take after this one where you get the
        opportunity to apply what you learn in this course when writing mobile
        apps. We look forward to seeing you in that course with the
        understanding of Swift you get in this course. The tasks in this course
        are designed to prepare you for the mobile course.
      </p>
      <h3>Windows Users</h3>
      <p>
        Windows users should follow the
        <a href="windows.html">Windows Install Instructions</a>
      </p>

      <h4>Creating a Swift Project</h4>
      <p>
        Create a directory on your computer that will eventually hold individual
        directories for each of the tasks. If a week has more than one task you
        will need a separate directory that represents a Swift project for each
        task. Therefore create directories in you course directory for
        week01_task_1 and week01_task_2. In the week01_task_1 directory, follow
        the instructions for 'Building an Executable' section in
        <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
          >this tutorial</a
        >. You will need to use your terminal app to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run VSCode and select <kbd>File->Open Workspace</kbd> and navigate to
        the task directory. Open the file called <kbd>main.swift</kbd> in the
        <kbd>Sources</kbd> directory. Add the following code to the file then
        save the file.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <pre>
<code class="swift">import Foundation

print("Installation test passed!")</code></pre>
      <p>
        Run the new code set as described in the 'Building an Executable'
        section of
        <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
          >the tutorial</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>macOS Users</h3>
      <p>
        The industry standard for developing Swift applications on macOS is
        Xcode.
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12"
          >You can install Xcode through this link.</a
        >
      </p>
      <h4>Creating a Swift Project</h4>
      <p>
        For this class we are creating apps to help you learn the language
        before you start to learn the libraries specific to the iOS platform.
        That's why you will be creating <strong>command line</strong> apps using
        Swift. This also helps you understand that Swift is a platform
        independent language, not something specific to Apple products. So let's
        create an app.
      </p>
      Following these steps will guarantee your setup is ready to go.
      <ol>
        <li>Press command-Shift-N</li>
        <li>Select "macOS" in the window's top menu bar.</li>
        <li>Select "Command Line Tool."</li>
        <li>Enter <kbd>week01_task_1</kbd> into the product name field.</li>
        <li>
          Select "Swift" from the "Language" pull down menu at the bottom of the
          window.
        </li>
        <li>
          Save the project anywhere you want. If I were you, I'd create a
          directory to hold each of the projects for the tasks for each of the
          weeks.
        </li>
        <li>In the left hand pane, select the "main.swift" file.</li>
        <li>Change "Hello, World!" to "Installation test passed!"</li>
        <li>
          Select command-r to compile and run the application. You will see
          "Installation test passed!" in the console on the lower right of the window.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Linux Users</h3>
      <p>
        Linux install instructions are available
        <a href="https://www.swift.org/getting-started/">at this link.</a> Most
        common distributions are supported. You will first need to download and
        install the dependencies. After you have downloaded the dependencies,
        you can download the current version of Swift at
        <a href="https://www.swift.org/download/">this link.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        After you have successfully downloaded the Swift toolchain, you will
        need to add it to your PATH. The following is a general command that
        will work, but could vary depending on your download location and the
        shell you are currently using.
      </p>
      <pre><code>echo "export PATH=/path/to/swift/directory/usr/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc</code></pre>
      <h4>Creating a Swift Project</h4>

      <p>
        Create a directory on your computer that will eventually hold individual
        directories for each of the tasks. If a week has more than one task you
        will need a separate directory that represents a Swift project for each
        task. Therefore create directories in you course directory for
        week01_task_1 and week01_task_2. In the week01_task_1 directory, follow
        the instructions for 'Building an Executable' section in
        <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
          >this tutorial</a
        >. You will need to use your terminal app to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run VSCode and select <kbd>File->Open Workspace</kbd> and navigate to
        the task directory. Open the file called <kbd>main.swift</kbd> in the
        <kbd>Sources</kbd> directory. Add the following code to the file then
        save the file.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <pre>
<code class="swift">import Foundation

print("Installation test passed!")</code></pre>
      <p>
        Run the new code set as described in the 'Building an Executable'
        section of<a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
          >the tutorial</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Task 2</h2>
      <h3>Explore Some Code</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="main.swift" target="_blank">Swift file</a> with some code
        that does something similar to code you've written in the past has been
        provided. Follow the instructions in the 'Creating a Swift Project'
        section above for your platform to create a Swift project called 
        <kbd>week01_task_2</kbd>. Paste the
        code from <a href="main.swift" target="_blank">this file</a> into the
        <kbd>main.swift</kbd> file in the your project (in the
        <kbd>Sources</kbd> directory for Windows and Linux users). Then compile
        and run it. The code you pasted into <kbd>main.swift</kbd> will help you
        begin to explore the Swift language's syntax. Don't be too worried if
        you don't completely understand all the code right now. The things you
        see there will be covered in more detail later in the class. It would be
        good for you if you expressed your curiosity and started using web
        searches to figure out some of the syntax you see.
      </p>
      <h2>Stretch Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Debugging your code for this and later classes will be much easier if
        you know how to use the stepwise debugger. This challenge will make your
        creation of code for this class much easier. If you learn how to use it
        now, it will save you hours of debugging later.
      </p>
      <h3>For Windows and Linux Users</h3>
      <p>
        Use the instructions in
        <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
          >the tutorial</a
        >
        for using the debugger as a template to stepwise debug the source code
        in Task 2. Set a breakpoint on line 13 of the source code and explore
        how the variables change and how functions are called. Make sure you
        'step into' the functions, not just see what they return.
      </p>
      <h3>macOS Users</h3>
      <p>
        Using the information in the
        <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10209/"
          >Discovering breakpoint improvements</a
        >
        video as a template, set a breakpoint on line 13 of the source code and
        explore how the variables change and how functions are called. Make sure
        you 'step into' the functions, not just see what they return.
