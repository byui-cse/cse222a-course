      <h1>Your Task</h1>
      <h2>Setup Your Environment and Explore It</h2>
      <p>
        You will be setting up your machines to write command-line applications. This is a language course, not a platform course. There is a mobile development course that you can take after this one where you get the opportunity to apply what you learn in this course when writing mobile apps. We look forward to seeing you in that course with the understanding of Swift you get in this course. The tasks in this course are designed to prepare you for the mobile course.

      <h3>Windows Users</h3>
      <p>
       There are many text editors you can use to write Swift code. The one being supported for Windows users in this class is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">VSCode</a>. This text editor was selected since you have experience using it in some of your previous classes. You can choose some other editor if you choose but you will be on your own to figure out how to manage it. Also, you can add plugins to VSCode to support your development in swift by choosing one from the VSCode plugin <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com">marketplace</a> if you would like. Any plugins you choose are not supported in this class.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get all of the Windows libraries and tools you will need, you will also have to install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/">Visual Studio Community</a> edition.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need to go to swift.org's <a href="https://swift.org/download/#releases">download site</a> and install the latest version of the compiler for Windows. Below is a video to help you with the Visual Studio Community installation and use.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to use Visual Studio Community instead of Visual Studio Code, feel free to do so.

      <h3>MacOS Users</h3>
      <p>
        The industry standard for developing Swift applications on MacOS. If you don't already have it installed on your machine, select the app store icon in the dock at the bottom of your window. Search for XCode and go through the installation process. XCode has everything in it you will need.
