      <h1>Your Tasks</h1>
      <h2>Task 1</h2>
      <h2>Setup Your Environment and Explore It</h2>
      <p>
        You will be setting up your machines to write command-line applications. This is a language course, not a platform course. There is a mobile development course that you can take after this one where you get the opportunity to apply what you learn in this course when writing mobile apps. We look forward to seeing you in that course with the understanding of Swift you get in this course. The tasks in this course are designed to prepare you for the mobile course.

      <h3>Windows Users</h3>
      <p>
       There are many text editors you can use to write Swift code. The one being supported for Windows users in this class is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">VSCode</a>. This text editor was selected since you have experience using it in some of your previous classes. You can choose some other editor if you choose but you will be on your own to figure out how to manage it. Also, you can add plugins to VSCode to support your development in swift by choosing one from the VSCode plugin <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com target="_blank"">marketplace</a> if you would like. Any plugins you choose are not supported in this class.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get all of the Windows libraries and tools you will need, you will also have to install <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Community</a> edition.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will need to go to swift.org's <a href="https://swift.org/download/#releases">download site</a> and install the latest version of the compiler for Windows. Below is a video to help you with the Visual Studio Community installation and use.
      </p>

      <h4>Creating a Swift Project</h4>
      <p>
        Create a directory on your computer that will eventually hold individual directories for each of the tasks. If a week has more than one task you will need a separate directory that represents a Swift project for each task. Therefore create directories in you course directory for week01_task_1 and week01_task_2.  In the week01_task_1 directory, follow the instructions for 'Building an Executable' section in <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. You will need to use your terminal app to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run VSCode and select <kbd>File->Open Workspace</kbd>. Open the file called <kbd>main.swift</kbd> in the <kbd>Sources</kbd> directory. Add the following code to the file then save the file.
      </p>
      <p>
      <pre>
<code class="swift">import Foundation

print("Installation test passed!")</code></pre>
      <p>
        Run the new code set as described in the 'Building an Executable' section of<a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">the tutorial</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>MacOS Users</h3>
      <p>
        The industry standard for developing Swift applications on MacOS. If you don't already have it installed on your machine, select the app store icon in the dock at the bottom of your window. Search for Xcode and go through the installation process. Xcode has everything in it you will need.
      </p>
      <h4>Creating a Swift Project</h4>
      <p>
        For this class we are creating apps to help you learn the language before you start to learn the libraries specific to the iOS platform. That's why you will be creating command line apps using Swift. This also helps you understand that Swift is a platform independent language, not something specific to Apple products. So let's create an app.
      </p>
      Following these steps will guarantee your setup is ready to go.
  <ol>
    <li>Press command-Shift-N</li>
    <li>Select "macOS" in the window's top menu bar.</li>
    <li>Select "Command Line Tool."</li>
    <li>Enter <kbd>week01_task_1</kbd> into the product name field.</li>
    <li>Select "Swift" from the "Language" pull down menu at the bottom of the window.</li>
    <li>Save the project anywhere you want. If I were you, I'd create a directory to hold each of the projects for the tasks for each of the weeks.</li>
    <li>In the left hand pane, select the "main.swift" file.</li>
    <li>Change "Hello, World!" to "Installation test passed!"</li>
    <li>Select command-r to compile and run the application. You will see "Hello, me!" in the console on the lower right of the window.</li>
  </ol>


<h3>Linux Users</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/Sdg0ef2PpBw" target="_blank">For Linux users, this video</a> will help you install and get started. Since you will 
  be working in Swift, 
  <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> is helpful. Focus only on the Linux portions. It is 
  very 'Linuxy', so be ready for it.&#129299; There will be a lot of command-line stuff you will need to do along with the use of the package manager for 
which ever Linux OS you have selected. Carefully follow the instructions and you should be good to go.
      </p>
      <h4>Creating a Swift Project</h4>
      


      <p>
        Create a directory on your computer that will eventually hold individual directories for each of the tasks. If a week has more than one task you will need a separate directory that represents a Swift project for each task. Therefore create directories in you course directory for week01_task_1 and week01_task_2.  In the week01_task_1 directory, follow the instructions for 'Building an Executable' section in <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. You will need to use your terminal app to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run VSCode and select <kbd>File->Open Workspace</kbd>. Open the file called <kbd>main.swift</kbd> in the <kbd>Sources</kbd> directory. Add the following code to the file then save the file.
      </p>
      <p>
      <pre>
<code class="swift">import Foundation

print("Installation test passed!")</code></pre>
      <p>
        Run the new code set as described in the 'Building an Executable' section of<a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">the tutorial</a>.
      </p>
  

      <h2>Task 2</h2>
      <h3>Explore Some Code</h3>
      <p>
        A <a href="main.swift" target="_blank">Swift file</a> with some code that does something similar to code you've written in the past has been provided. Follow the instructions in the 'Building an Executable' section of<a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">the tutorial</a> to create a Swift project called <kbd>week01_task_2</kbd>. Paste the code from <a href="main.swift" target="_blank">this file</a> into the <kbd>main.swift</kbd> file in the <kbd>your project (in the <kbd>Sources</kbd> directory for Windows and Linux users). Then compile and run it. The code you pasted into <kbd>main.swift</kbd> will help you begin to explore the Swift language's syntax. Don't be too worried if you don't completely understand all the code right now. The things you see there will be covered in more detail later in the class. It would be good for you if you expressed your curiosity and started using web searches to figure out some of the syntax you see.
      </p>
      <h2>Stretch Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Debugging your code for this and later classes will be much easier if you know how to use the stepwise debugger. This challenge will make your creation of code for this class much easier. If you learn how to use it now, it will save you hours of debugging later.
      </p>
      <h3>For Windows and Linux Users</h3>
      <p>
        Use the instructions in <a href="https://swift.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">the tutorial</a> for using the debugger as a template to stepwise debug the source code in Task 2. Set a breakpoint on line 13 of the source code and explore how the variables change and how functions are called. Make sure you 'step into' the functions, not just see what they return.
      </p>
      <h3>MacOS Users</h3>
      <p>
        Using the information in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10209/">Discovering breakpoint improvements</a> video as a template, set a breakpoint on line 13 of the source code and explore how the variables change and how functions are called. Make sure you 'step into' the functions, not just see what they return.
