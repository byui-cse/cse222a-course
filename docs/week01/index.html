	<h2>The Why of Swift</h2>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>
		All languages have a few needs in common. They should to be safe to write (reducing crashes and hacking), fast, and expressive.
		Not all languages achieve all these needs. Sometimes this is due to the age of the language. C and C++ are examples of this. 
		Neither of these languages are particularly designed to be safe. Safty wasn't an issue when they were initially created. For C, 
		networks of distinct, connected computers did not exist outside of labs where networking was being studied. For C++, networks were 
		brand new and not well understood. This meant that, when these languages were created, there was no thought about someone 'hacking into' 
		your computer remotely. Therefore, no care was taken to reduce this possibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some might think that Swift was created only for Apple devices, but that wasn't and isn't 
		<a href="https://swift.org/about/"  target="_blank">the stated goal</a> 
		of the creators and developers of Swift. What they wanted to create was a general purpose language that could span everything from watches to 
		huge servers. They also wanted to make the language safe to use, fast, and have an expressive syntax.
	</p>
	<p>
		To meet these requirements, they pulled concepts from many different languages. It may be supprising to some, but Objective-C, a language Apple 
		supported previously, provided none to little 
		of the syntax for Swift. Instead, languages such as haskell and python have had much more of an impact on Swift's syntax. So much so, that 
		Apple's new library for creating user interfaces is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"  target="_blank">declarative</a>, not object oriented. If class doesn't cover anything Apple specific. If 
		you want to know that library, you can study it on your own or take the mobile development course after completing this and the 
		Kotlin language course.
	</p>
	<h3>Python 3 and Swift are Cousins</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestery of both Swift and Python. Since an earlier version of Python is an ancestor of Swift
       	you can expect to see some
	things in Swift that remind you of what you learned regarding coding when you used Python. Python is not Swift's only ancester. 
	A very strong contributor to Swift is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)"  target="_blank">Haskell language</a>. 
	Because of this ancestry, Swift has a much stronger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"  target="_blank">functional programming</a> foundation than Python and many other languages do.
	Other examples of the influence of ancestral languages include, Haskell's data passing approach is an important part of Swift and it's efficiency, Rust's safety approach feeds Swift's, and Ruby's objects informed 
	the creation of Swift's.
	</p>
	<p>As you learn Swift and become familiar with its ancestral languages, you will be able to pick out of the syntax and behavior influences of its ancestors.</p>

<h2>Installations</h2>
	<h3>The IDE</h3>
	<p>If you are developing on Linux, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) selected for this course is 
	<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>. Go to the 
	<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">site for Visual Studio Code</a> to download the installer for your
	operating system. When you start the download you will be taken to a page that will help you get started. 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/Sdg0ef2PpBw">This video</a> will help you install and get started. Since you will 
	be working in Swift, 
	<a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/8325890-a-complete-guide-to-swift-development-on-linux" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> is helpful. It is 
	very 'Linuxy', so be ready for it.&#129299; There will be a lot of command-line stuff you will need to do along with the use of the package manager for 
which ever Linux OS you have selected. Follow the instructions and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>
	If you ar developing on MacOS, the IDE selected for this course is Xcode. No suprises there.&#128526 Make sure you have the latest version of MacOS and then 
	use the App Store application on you Mac. Enter 'xcode' in the search field and download Xcode. This will take a while. While you wait, you could always check out 
	what the Linux users have to do. &#129395;
</p>
<p>
	When you launch Xcode for the first time, a dialog will ask you to install some supporting software. Do so. Say yes.
</p>


<h2>Test Your Tools</h2>
	<h3>Linux</h3>
	<p>
		If you followed the <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/8325890-a-complete-guide-to-swift-development-on-linux" target="_blank">Linux tutorial</a>, you have already tested you setup.
	</p>
	<h3>MacOS</h3>
	Following these steps will guarentee your setup is ready to go.
	<ol>
		<li>Press command-Shift-N</li>
		<li>Select "macOS" in the window's top menu bar.</li>
		<li>Select "Command Line Tool."</li>
		<li>Enter a product name. I use "Junk" when I know that's what it is and I can throw it away at any time without causing me pain.</li>
		<li>Select "Swift" from the "Language" pulldown menu at the bottom of the window.</li>
		<li>Save the project anywhere you want.</li>
		<li>In the left hand pane, select the "main.swift" file.</li>
		<li>Change "Hello, World!" to "Hello, me!"</li>
		<li>Select command-r to compile and run the application. You will see "Hello, me!" in the console on the lower right of the window.</li>
		<li>Click on the 11 indicating the eleventh line of the code file. This sets a break point for the stepwise debugger and is indicated by a colored rectangle 
		with a triangle on the end.</li>
		<li>Select command-r again.</li>
		<li>Execution stops before line 11 is executed.</li>
		<li>Move your mouse over and click this button on the bar between the code and the console.<img src="stepover.png" alt="the stepover button is a bent arrow over a bar"></li>
		<li>After you click the stepover button, you will again see "Hello, me!" in the console.</li>
		<li>Find the "Continue" button to the left of the stepover button to run the application to the end.</li>
		<li>&#129395;</li>
	</ol>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
	<p>The work you do using these two tools will flow like this. Each time you are asked to do an assignment, you will create a directory named for the assignment. For example, if you were asked for your assignment to write code that calculated loan payments, you could create a folder called loan_pay_calc. Then, using your operating system,
       	you would copy index.html and learn.js from first_load_js into the loan_pay_calc directory. Finally, you would open the loan_pay_calc folder in VS Code, open the learn.js file, and replace the JavaScript code in learn.js with 
	code that would calculate loan payments.</p>
	<p>If you follow this pattern for each assignment, you will reduce your workload.</p>
