      <h1>The Why of Swift</h1>
      <h2>Some Background</h2>
      <p>
        All languages have a few needs in common. They should to be safe to
        write (reducing crashes and hacking), fast, and expressive. Not all
        languages achieve all these needs. Sometimes this is due to the age of
        the language. C and C++ are examples of this. Neither of these languages
        are particularly designed to be safe. Safety wasn't an issue when they
        were initially created. For C, networks of distinct, connected computers
        did not exist outside of labs where networking was being studied. For
        C++, networks were brand new and not well understood. This meant that,
        when these languages were created, there was no thought about someone
        'hacking into' your computer remotely. Therefore, no care was taken to
        reduce this possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some might think that Swift was created only for Apple devices, but that
        wasn't and isn't
        <a href="https://swift.org/about/" target="_blank">the stated goal</a>
        of the creators and developers of Swift. What they wanted to create was
        a general purpose language that could span everything from watches to
        huge servers. They also wanted to make the language safe to use, fast,
        and have an expressive syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        To meet these requirements, they pulled concepts from many different
        languages. It may be supprising to some, but Objective-C, a language
        Apple supported previously, provided none to little of the syntax for
        Swift. Instead, languages such as haskell and python have had much more
        of an impact on Swift's syntax. So much so, that Apple's new library for
        creating user interfaces is
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"
          target="_blank"
          >declarative</a
        >, not object oriented. this class doesn't cover anything Apple
        specific. If you want to know that library, you can study it on your own
        or take the mobile development course after completing this and the
        Kotlin language course.
      </p>
      <h3>Python 3 and Swift are Cousins</h3>
      <p>
        Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestry of both Swift and Python.
        Since an earlier version of Python is an ancestor of Swift you can
        expect to see some things in Swift that remind you of what you learned
        regarding coding when you used Python. Python is not Swift's only
        ancestor. A very strong contributor to Swift is the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)"
          target="_blank"
          >Haskell language</a
        >. Because of this ancestry, Swift has a much stronger
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"
          target="_blank"
          >functional programming</a
        >
        foundation than Python and many other languages do. Other examples of
        the influence of ancestral languages include, Haskell's data passing
        approach is an important part of Swift and it's efficiency, Rust's
        safety approach feeds Swift's, and Ruby's objects informed the creation
        of Swift's.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you learn Swift and become familiar with its ancestral languages, you
        will be able to pick out of the syntax and behavior influences of its
        ancestors.

      <h1>Installations</h1>
      <h2>The IDE</h2>
      <p>
        If you are developing on Linux or Windows, the Integrated Development
        Environment (IDE) selected for this course is
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"
          >Visual Studio Code</a
        >. Go to the
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"
          >site for Visual Studio Code</a
        >
        to download the installer for your operating system. When you start the
        download you will be taken to a page that will help you get started.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are developing on macOS, the IDE selected for this course is
        Xcode. No surprises there. ðŸ˜Ž Make sure you have the latest version of
        macOS and then use the App Store application on you Mac. Enter 'Xcode'
        in the search field and download Xcode. This will take a while. While
        you wait, you could always check out what the Linux and Windows users
        have to do. ðŸ¥³
      </p>
      <p>
        When you launch Xcode for the first time, a dialog will ask you to
        install some supporting software.
      </p>

      <h2>Test Your Tools</h2>
      <p>The tasks for this week include testing your tools.</p>

      <h2>Workflow</h2>
      <p>
        The work you do using these two tools will flow like this. Each time you
        are asked to do a task, you will create a project named for the task.
        For example, if you were asked for your task to write code that
        calculated loan payments, you could create a project called
        loan_pay_calc. If you follow this pattern for each assignment, you will
        reduce your workload. Do not create a single project to hold all of your
        tasks. If you do, you will regret that choice by the end of the
        semester.
